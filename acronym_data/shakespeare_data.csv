nay but this dotage of our generals oerflows the measure those his goodly eyes that oer the files and musters of the war have glowd like plated mars now bend now turn the office and devotion of their view upon a tawny front his captains heart which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst the buckles on his breast reneges all temper and is become the bellows and the fan to cool a gipsys lust
look where they come take but good note and you shall see in him
the triple pillar of the world transformd into a strumpets fool behold and see
if it be love indeed tell me how much
theres beggary in the love that can be reckond
ill set a bourn how far to be beloved
then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
news my good lord from rome
grates me the sum
nay hear them antony fulvia perchance is angry or who knows if the scarcebearded caesar have not sent his powerful mandate to you do this or this take in that kingdom and enfranchise that perform t or else we damn thee
how my love
perchance
nay and most like you must not stay here longer your dismission is come from caesar therefore hear it antony
wheres fulvias process
caesars i would say

here is my space
kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike feeds beast as man the nobleness of life is to do thus when such a mutual pair and such a twain can dot in which i bind on pain of punishment the world to weet we stand up peerless
excellent falsehood

whom every thing becomes to chide to laugh to weep whose every passion fully strives to make itself in thee fair and admired
no messenger but thine and all alone tonight well wander through the streets and note the qualities of people
come my queen last night you did desire it speak not to us
is caesar with antonius prized so slight
sir sometimes when he is not antony he comes too short of that great property which still should go with antony
i am full sorry that he approves the common liar who thus speaks of him at rome but i will hope of better deeds tomorrow
rest you happy

amen
lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold they would make themselves whores but theyld dot
hush
here comes antony
not he the queen
saw you my lord
no lady
was he not here
no madam
he was disposed to mirth but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him
enobarbus
madam
seek him and bring him hither
wheres alexas
here at your service
my lord approaches
we will not look upon him go with us
fulvia thy wife first came into the field
against my brother lucius
ay but soon that war had end and the times state made friends of them joining their force gainst caesar whose better issue in the war from italy upon the first encounter drave them
well what worst
the nature of bad news infects the teller
when it concerns the fool or coward
on things that are past are done with me
tis thus who tells me true though in his tale lie death i hear him as he flatterd
labienus this is stiff newshath with his parthian force extended asia from euphrates his conquering banner shook from syria to lydia and to ionia whilst antony thou wouldst say o my lord
speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is calld in rome rail thou in fulvias phrase and taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter
o then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds lie still and our ills told us is as our earing
fare thee well awhile
at your noble pleasure
from sicyon ho the news
speak there
the man from sicyonis there such an one
he stays upon your will
let him appear
these strong egyptian fetters i must break or lose myself in dotage
what are you
fulvia thy wife is dead
where died she
in sicyon her length of sickness with what else more serious importeth thee to know this bears
forbear me
theres a great spirit gone
thus did i desire it what our contempt doth often hurl from us we wish it ours again the present pleasure by revolution lowering does become the opposite of itself shes good being gone the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch
how now
enobarbus
whats your pleasure sir
i must with haste from hence
why then we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure deaths the word
i must be gone
under a compelling occasion let women die it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing
cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying
she is cunning past mans thought
alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a shower of rain as well as jove
would i had never seen her
o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel
fulvia is dead
sir
fulvia is dead
fulvia
dead
why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new
if there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
the business she hath broached in the state cannot endure my absence
and the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatras which wholly depends on your abode
no more light answers
let our officers have notice what we purpose
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part
for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linkd to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o the world may danger much is breeding which like the coursers hair hath yet but life and not a serpents poison
say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence
i shall dot
where is he
i did not see him since
see where he is whos with him what he does i did not send you if you find him sad say i am dancing if in mirth report that i am sudden sick quick and return
madam methinks if you did love him dearly you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him
what should i do i do not
in each thing give him way cross him nothing
thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
tempt him not so too far i wish forbear in time we hate that which we often fear
but here comes antony
i am sick and sullen
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose help me away dear charmian i shall fall it cannot be thus long the sides of nature will not sustain it
now my dearest queen pray you stand further from me
whats the matter
i know by that same eye theres some good news
what says the married woman
you may go would she had never given you leave to come
let her not say tis i that keep you here i have no power upon you hers you are
the gods best know o never was there queen so mightily betrayd
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted
cleopatra why should i think you can be mine and true though you in swearing shake the throned gods who have been false to fulvia
riotous madness to be entangled with those mouthmade vows which break themselves in swearing
most sweet queen nay pray you seek no colour for your going but bid farewell and go when you sued staying then was the time for words no going then eternity was in our lips and eyes bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor but was a race of heaven they are so still or thou the greatest soldier of the world art turnd the greatest liar
how now lady
i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt
hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you
our italy shines oer with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemnd pompey rich in his fathers honour creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvias death
though age from folly could not give me freedom it does from childishness can fulvia die
shes dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died
o most false love
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water
now i see i see in fulvias death how mine received shall be
quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give the advice
by the fire that quickens nilus slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affectst
cut my lace charmian come but let it be i am quickly ill and well so antony loves
my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honourable trial
so fulvia told me
i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look life perfect honour
youll heat my blood no more
you can do better yet but this is meetly
now by my sword and target
still he mends but this is not the best
look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe
ill leave you lady
courteous lord one word
sir you and i must part but thats not it sir you and i have loved but theres not it that you know well something it is i would o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself
tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this
but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you your honour calls you hence therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
and all the gods go with you
upon your sword sit laurel victory
and smooth success be strewd before your feet
let us go
come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here gost yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee
away
you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesars natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow
i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by nights blackness hereditary rather than purchased what he cannot change than what he chooses
you are too indulgent
let us grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemishyet must antony no way excuse his soils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness
if he filld his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him fort but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ourstis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment
heres more news
thy biddings have been done and every hour most noble caesar shalt thou have report how tis abroad
pompey is strong at sea and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feard caesar to the ports the discontents repair and mens reports give him much wrongd
i should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wishd until he were and the ebbd man neer loved till neer worth love comes deard by being lackd
this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion
caesar i bring thee word menecrates and menas famous pirates make the sea serve them which they ear and wound with keels of every kind many hot inroads they make in italy the borders maritime lack blood to think ont and flush youth revolt no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon taken as seen for pompeys name strikes more than could his war resisted
antony leave thy lascivious wassails
when thou once wast beaten from modena where thou slewst hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou foughtst against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsedst on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lankd not
tis pity of him
let his shames quickly drive him to rome tis time we twain did show ourselves i the field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness
tomorrow caesar i shall be furnishd to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time
till which encounter it is my business too
farewell
farewell my lord what you shall know meantime of stirs abroad i shall beseech you sir to let me be partaker
doubt not sir i knew it for my bond
charmian
madam
ha ha
give me to drink mandragora
why madam
that i might sleep out this great gap of time my antony is away
you think of him too much
o tis treason
madam i trust not so
thou eunuch mardian
whats your highness pleasure
not now to hear thee sing i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has tis well for thee that being unseminard thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt
hast thou affections
yes gracious madam
indeed
not in deed madam for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done yet have i fierce affections and think what venus did with mars
o charmian where thinkst thou he is now
stands he or sits he
or does he walk
or is he on his horse
o happy horse to bear the weight of antony
do bravely horse
for wotst thou whom thou movest
the demiatlas of this earth the arm and burgonet of men
hes speaking now or murmuring wheres my serpent of old nile
for so he calls me now i feed myself with most delicious poison
think on me that am with phoebus amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time
broadfronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life
sovereign of egypt hail
how much unlike art thou mark antony
yet coming from him that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee
how goes it with my brave mark antony
last thing he did dear queen he kissdthe last of many doubled kisses this orient pearl
his speech sticks in my heart
mine ear must pluck it thence
good friend quoth he say the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster at whose foot to mend the petty present i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east say thou shall call her mistress
so he nodded and soberly did mount an armgaunt steed who neighd so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbd by him
what was he sad or merry
like to the time o the year between the extremes of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
o welldivided disposition
note him note him good charmian tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by his he was not merry which seemd to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy but between both o heavenly mingle
best thou sad or merry the violence of either thee becomes so does it no man else
metst thou my posts
ay madam twenty several messengers why do you send so thick
whos born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar
ink and paper charmian
welcome my good alexas
did i charmian ever love caesar so
o that brave caesar
be choked with such another emphasis
say the brave antony
the valiant caesar
by isis i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men
by your most gracious pardon i sing but after you
my salad days when i was green in judgment cold in blood to say as i said then
but come away get me ink and paper he shall have every day a several greeting or ill unpeople egypt
if the great gods be just they shall assist the deeds of justest men
know worthy pompey that what they do delay they not deny
whiles we are suitors to their throne decays the thing we sue for
we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers
i shall do well the people love me and the sea is mine my powers are crescent and my auguring hope says it will come to the full
mark antony in egypt sits at dinner and will make no wars without doors caesar gets money where he loses hearts lepidus flatters both of both is flatterd but he neither loves nor either cares for him
caesar and lepidus are in the field a mighty strength they carry
where have you this
tis false
from silvius sir
he dreams i know they are in rome together looking for antony
but all the charms of love salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip
let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts keep his brain fuming epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour even till a lethed dulness
how now varrius
this is most certain that i shall deliver mark antony is every hour in rome expected since he went from egypt tis a space for further travel
i could have given less matter a better ear
menas i did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donnd his helm for such a petty war his soldiership is twice the other twain but let us rear the higher our opinion that our stirring can from the lap of egypts widow pluck the neerlustwearied antony
i cannot hope caesar and antony shall well greet together his wife thats dead did trespasses to caesar his brother warrd upon him although i think not moved by antony
i know not menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater
weret not that we stand up against them all twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference we yet not know
bet as our gods will havet
it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands
come menas
good enobarbus tis a worthy deed and shall become you well to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech
i shall entreat him to answer like himself if caesar move him let antony look over caesars head and speak as loud as mars
by jupiter were i the wearer of antonius beard i would not shavet today
tis not a time for private stomaching
every time serves for the matter that is then born int
but small to greater matters must give way
not if the small come first
your speech is passion but pray you stir no embers up
here comes the noble antony
and yonder caesar
if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius
i do not know mecaenas ask agrippa
noble friends that which combined us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us
whats amiss may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to the matter
tis spoken well
were we before our armies and to fight
i should do thus
welcome to rome
thank you
sit
sit sir
nay then
i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not
i must be laughd at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laughd at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concernd me
my being in egypt caesar what wast to you
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question
how intend you practised
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me
your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war
you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you
did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause
of this my letters before did satisfy you
if youll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses
not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace
as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife
would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women
so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience
sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i the morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have askd him pardon
let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him
you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with
soft caesar
no lepidus let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lackd it
but on caesar the article of my oath
to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied
neglected rather and then when poisond hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge
as nearly as i may ill play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it
truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case
tis noble spoken
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you
worthily spoken mecaenas
or if you borrow one anothers love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
thou art a soldier only speak no more
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
go to then your considerate stone
i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech fort cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so differing in their acts
yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o the world i would pursue it
give me leave caesar speak agrippa
thou hast a sister by the mothers side admired octavia great mark antony is now a widower
say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness
i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak
to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter
by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing truths would be tales where now half tales be truths her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her
pardon what i have spoke for tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated
will caesar speak
not till he hears how antony is touchd with what is spoke already
what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good
the power of caesar and his power unto octavia
may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment
let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs
there is my hand
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again
happily amen
i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him
time calls upons of us must pompey presently be sought or else he seeks out us
where lies he
about the mount misenum
what is his strength by land
great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master
so is the fame
would we had spoke together
haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talkd of
with most gladness and do invite you to my sisters view whither straight ill lead you
let us lepidus not lack your company
noble antony not sickness should detain me
welcome from egypt sir
half the heart of caesar worthy mecaenas
my honourable friend agrippa
good enobarbus
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested
you stayed well by t in egypt
ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking
eight wildboars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there is this true
this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
shes a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus
there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised well for her
i will tell you
the barge she sat in like a burnishd throne burnd on the water the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes
for her own person it beggard all description she did lie in her pavilionclothofgold of tissue oerpicturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with diverscolourd fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did
o rare for antony
her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i the eyes and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands that yarely frame the office
from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs
the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthroned i the marketplace did sit alone whistling to the air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature
rare egyptian
upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated our courteous antony whom neer the word of no woman heard speak being barberd ten times oer goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only
royal wench
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed he ploughd her and she croppd
i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless power breathe forth
now antony must leave her utterly
never he will not age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish
if beauty wisdom modesty can settle the heart of antony octavia is a blessed lottery to him
let us go
good enobarbus make yourself my guest whilst you abide here
humbly sir i thank you
the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you
good night sir
my octavia read not my blemishes in the worlds report i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by the rule
good night dear lady
good night sir
good night
now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt
would i had never come from thence nor you thither
if you can your reason
i see it in my motion have it not in my tongue but yet hie you to egypt again
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesars or mine
caesars
therefore o antony stay not by his side thy demon thats thy spirit which keeps thee is noble courageous high unmatchable where caesars is not but near him thy angel becomes a fear as being oerpowerd therefore make space enough between you
speak this no more
to none but thee no more but when to thee
if thou dost play with him at any game thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck he beats thee gainst the odds thy lustre thickens when he shines by i say again thy spirit is all afraid to govern thee near him but he away tis noble
get thee gone say to ventidius i would speak with him he shall to parthia
be it art or hap he hath spoken true the very dice obey him and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance if we draw lots he speeds his cocks do win the battle still of mine when it is all to nought and his quails ever beat mine inhoopd at odds
i will to egypt and though i make this marriage for my peace i the east my pleasure lies

thourt an honest man
caesar and he are greater friends than ever

and kindly creatures turn all to serpents
call the slave again though i am mad i will not bite him call
he is afeard to come
i will not hurt him
these hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself since i myself have given myself the cause
come hither sir
though it be honest it is never good to bring bad news give to a gracious message
an host of tongues but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt
i have done my duty

i cannot hate thee worser than i do if thou again say yes
hes married madam
the gods confound thee
dost thou hold there still
should i lie madam
o i would thou didst so half my egypt were submerged and made a cistern for scaled snakes
go get thee hence hadst thou narcissus in thy face to me thou wouldst appear most ugly
he is married
i crave your highness pardon
he is married
take no offence that i would not offend you to punish me for what you make me do
seems much unequal hes married to octavia
o that his fault should make a knave of thee that art not what thourt sure of
get thee hence the merchandise which thou hast brought from rome are all too dear for me lie they upon thy hand and be undone by em
good your highness patience
in praising antony i have dispraised caesar
many times madam
i am paid fort now
lead me from hence i faint o iras charmian
tis no matter
go to the fellow good alexas bid him report the feature of octavia her years her inclination let him not leave out the colour of her hair bring me word quickly
let him for ever golet him notcharmian though he be painted one way like a gorgon the other ways a mars
bid you alexas bring me word how tall she is
pity me charmian but do not speak to me
lead me to my chamber
your hostages i have so have you mine and we shall talk before we fight
most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considerd let us know if twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here
to you all three the senators alone of this great world chief factors for the gods i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want having a son and friends since julius caesar who at philippi the good brutus ghosted there saw you labouring for him
what wast that moved pale cassius to conspire and what made the allhonourd honest roman brutus with the armd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom to drench the capitol but that they would have one man but a man
and that is it hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen the angerd ocean foams with which i meant to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father
take your time
thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails well speak with thee at sea at land thou knowst how much we do oercount thee
at land indeed thou dost oercount me of my fathers house but since the cuckoo builds not for himself remain int as thou mayst
be pleased to tell us for this is from the presenthow you take the offers we have sent you
theres the point
which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced
and what may follow to try a larger fortune
you have made me offer of sicily sardinia and i must rid all the sea of pirates then to send measures of wheat to rome this greed upon to part with unhackd edges and bear back our targes undinted
thats our offer
know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience though i lose the praise of it by telling you must know when caesar and your brother were at blows your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly
i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you
let me have your hand i did not think sir to have met you here
the beds i the east are soft and thanks to you that calld me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gaind by t
since i saw you last there is a change upon you
well i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal
well met here
i hope so lepidus
thus we are agreed i crave our composition may be written and seald between us
thats the next to do
well feast each other ere we part and lets draw lots who shall begin
that will i pompey
no antony take the lot but first or last your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there
you have heard much
i have fair meanings sir
and fair words to them
then so much have i heard and i have heard apollodorus carried no more of that he did so
what i pray you
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
i know thee now how farest thou soldier
well and well am like to do for i perceive four feasts are toward
let me shake thy hand i never hated thee i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior
sir i never loved you much but i ha praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did
enjoy thy plainness it nothing ill becomes thee
aboard my galley i invite you all will you lead lords
show us the way sir
come
none made this treatyyou and i have known sir
at sea i think
we have sir
you have done well by water
and you by land
i will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what i have done by land
nor what i have done by water
yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea
and you by land
there i deny my land service
but give me your hand menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing
all mens faces are true whatsomeer their hands are
but there is never a fair woman has a true face
no slander they steal hearts
we came hither to fight with you
for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
if he do sure he cannot weept back again
youve said sir
we looked not for mark antony here pray you is he married to cleopatra
caesars sister is called octavia
true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
pray ye sir
tis true
then is caesar and he for ever knit together
if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties
i think so too
but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
who would not have his wife so
not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance
antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here
and thus it may be
come sir will you aboard
i have a health for you
i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt
come lets away
here theyll be man
some o their plants are illrooted already the least wind i the world will blow them down
lepidus is highcoloured
they have made him drink almsdrink
as they pinch one another by the disposition he cries out no more reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to the drink
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion
why this is to have a name in great mens fellowship i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave
to be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move int are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks
none the flow o the nile by certain scales i the pyramid they know by the height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest
youve strange serpents there
ay lepidus
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile
they are so
sitand some wine
a health to lepidus
i am not so well as i should be but ill neer out
not till you have slept i fear me youll be in till then
nay certainly i have heard the ptolemies pyramises are very goodly things without contradiction i have heard that
none none what ist
none thee captain and hear me speak a word
none this wine for lepidus
what manner o thing is your crocodile
it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with its own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates
what colour is it of
of it own colour too
tis a strange serpent
tis so
and the tears of it are wet
will this description satisfy him
with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure
none that
away
do as i bid you
wheres this cup i calld for
none wilt hear me rise from thy stool
none the matter
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
thou hast served me with much faith
whats else to say
be jolly lords
these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink
wilt thou be lord of all the world
what sayst thou
wilt thou be lord of the whole world
thats twice
how should that be
but entertain it and though thou think me poor i am the man will give thee all the world
hast thou drunk well
now pompey i have kept me from the cup
thou art if thou darest be the earthly jove whateer the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine if thou wilt hat
show me which way
these three worldsharers these competitors are in thy vessel let me cut the cable and when we are put off fall to their throats all there is thine
ah this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke ont
in me tis villany in theet had been good service
thou must know tis not my profit that does lead mine honour mine honour it
repent that eer thy tongue hath so betrayd thine act being done unknown i should have found it afterwards well done but must condemn it now
desist and drink
none ill never follow thy palld fortunes more
who seeks and will not take when once tis offerd shall never find it more
this health to lepidus
bear him ashore
ill pledge it for him pompey
heres to thee menas
enobarbus welcome
fill till the cup be hid
theres a strong fellow menas
why
a bears the third part of the world man seest not
the third part then is drunk would it were all that it might go on wheels
drink thou increase the reels
come
this is not yet an alexandrian feast
it ripens towards it
strike the vessels ho
here is to caesar
i could well forbeart
its monstrous labour when i wash my brain and it grows fouler
be a child o the time
possess it ill make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one
ha my brave emperor
shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals and celebrate our drink
lets hat good soldier
come lets all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steepd our sense in soft and delicate lethe
all take hands
make battery to our ears with the loud music the while ill place you then the boy shall sing the holding every man shall bear as loud as his strong sides can volley
come thou monarch of the vine plumpy bacchus with pink eyne
in thy fats our cares be drownd with thy grapes our hairs be crownd cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round
what would you more
pompey good night
good brother let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity
gentle lords lets part you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost antickd us all
what needs more words
good night
good antony your hand
ill try you on the shore
and shall sir gives your hand
o antony you have my fathers housebut what
we are friends
come down into the boat
take heed you fall not
menas ill not on shore
no to my cabin
these drums
these trumpets flutes
what
let neptune hear we bid a loud farewell to these great fellows sound and be hangd sound out
ho
says a theres my cap
ho
noble captain come
now darting parthia art thou struck and now pleased fortune does of marcus crassus death make me revenger
bear the kings sons body before our army
thy pacorus orodes pays this for marcus crassus
noble ventidius whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm the fugitive parthians follow spur through media mesopotamia and the shelters whither the routed fly so thy grand captain antony shall set thee on triumphant chariots and put garlands on thy head
o silius silius i have done enough a lower place note well may make too great an act for learn this silius better to leave undone than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serves away
caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person sossius one of my place in syria his lieutenant for quick accumulation of renown which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
who does i the wars more than his captain can becomes his captains captain and ambition the soldiers virtue rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him
i could do more to do antonius good but twould offend him and in his offence should my performance perish
thou hast ventidius that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction
thou wilt write to antony
ill humbly signify what in his name that magical word of war we have effected how with his banners and his wellpaid ranks the neeryetbeaten horse of parthia we have jaded out o the field
where is he now
he purposeth to athens whither with what haste the weight we must convey withs will permit we shall appear before him
on there pass along
what are the brothers parted
they have dispatchd with pompey he is gone the other three are sealing
octavia weeps to part from rome caesar is sad and lepidus since pompeys feast as menas says is troubled with the green sickness
tis a noble lepidus
a very fine one o how he loves caesar
nay but how dearly he adores mark antony
caesar
why hes the jupiter of men
whats antony
the god of jupiter
spake you of caesar
how
the nonpareil
o antony
o thou arabian bird
would you praise caesar say caesar go no further
indeed he plied them both with excellent praises
but he loves caesar best yet he loves antony ho
hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot think speak cast write sing number ho
his love to antony
but as for caesar kneel down kneel down and wonder
both he loves
they are his shards and he their beetle
so this is to horse
adieu noble agrippa
good fortune worthy soldier and farewell
no further sir
you take from me a great part of myself use me well in t
sister prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee and as my farthest band shall pass on thy approof
most noble antony let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love to keep it builded be the ram to batter the fortress of it for better might we have loved without this mean if on both parts this be not cherishd
make me not offended in your distrust
i have said
you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends
we will here part
farewell my dearest sister fare thee well the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort
fare thee well
my noble brother
the april s in her eyes it is loves spring and these the showers to bring it on
be cheerful
sir look well to my husbands house and what octavia
ill tell you in your ear
her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tonguethe swans downfeather that stands upon the swell at full of tide and neither way inclines
none none none were he a horse so is he being a man
none when antony found julius caesar dead he cried almost to roaring and he wept when at philippi he found brutus slain
none troubled with a rheum what willingly he did confound he waild believet till i wept too
no sweet octavia you shall hear from me still the time shall not outgo my thinking on you
come sir come ill wrestle with you in my strength of love look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods
adieu be happy
let all the number of the stars give light to thy fair way
farewell farewell
farewell
where is the fellow
half afeard to come
go to go to
come hither sir
good majesty herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased
that herods head ill have but how when antony is gone through whom i might command it
come thou near
most gracious majesty didst thou behold octavia
ay dread queen
where
madam in rome i lookd her in the face and saw her led between her brother and mark antony
is she as tall as me
she is not madam
didst hear her speak
is she shrilltongued or low
madam i heard her speak she is lowvoiced
thats not so good he cannot like her long
like her
o isis
tis impossible
i think so charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish
what majesty is in her gait
remember if eer thou lookdst on majesty
she creeps her motion and her station are as one she shows a body rather than a life a statue than a breather
is this certain
or i have no observance
three in egypt cannot make better note
hes very knowing i do perceivet theres nothing in her yet the fellow has good judgment
excellent
guess at her years i prithee
madam she was a widow widow
charmian hark
and i do think shes thirty
bearst thou her face in mind
ist long or round
round even to faultiness
for the most part too they are foolish that are so
her hair what colour
brown madam and her forehead as low as she would wish it
theres gold for thee
thou must not take my former sharpness ill i will employ thee back again i find thee most fit for business go make thee ready our letters are prepared
a proper man
indeed he is so i repent me much that so i harried him
why methinks by him this creatures no such thing
nothing madam
the man hath seen some majesty and should know
hath he seen majesty
isis else defend and serving you so long
i have one thing more to ask him yet good charmian but tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me where i will write
all may be well enough
i warrant you madam
nay nay octavia not only that that were excusable that and thousands more of semblable importbut he hath waged new wars gainst pompey made his will and read it to public ear spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not but pay me terms of honour cold and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not tookt or did it from his teeth
o my good lord believe not all or if you must believe stomach not all
a more unhappy lady if this division chance neer stood between praying for both parts the good gods me presently when i shall pray o bless my lord and husband
undo that prayer by crying out as loud o bless my brother
husband win win brother prays and destroys the prayer no midway twixt these extremes at all
gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honour i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless
but as you requested yourself shall go between s the mean time lady ill raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste so your desires are yours
thanks to my lord
the jove of power make me most weak most weak your reconciler
wars twixt you twain would be as if the world should cleave and that slain men should solder up the rift
when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them
provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to
how now friend eros
theres strange news come sir
what man
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey
this is old what is the success
caesar having made use of him in the wars gainst pompey presently denied him rivality would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to pompey upon his own appeal seizes him so the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine
then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more and throw between them all the food thou hast theyll grind the one the other
wheres antony
hes walking in the gardenthus and spurns the rush that lies before him cries fool lepidus
and threats the throat of that his officer that murderd pompey
our great navys riggd
for italy and caesar
more domitius my lord desires you presently my news i might have told hereafter
twill be naught but let it be
bring me to antony
come sir
contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria heres the manner of t i the marketplace on a tribunal silverd cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion whom they call my fathers son and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them
unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen
this in the public eye
i the common showplace where they exercise
his sons he there proclaimd the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia
he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assignd syria cilicia and phoenicia she in the habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeard and oft before gave audience as tis reported so
let rome be thus informd
who queasy with his insolence already will their good thoughts call from him
the people know it and have now received his accusations
who does he accuse
caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoild we had not rated him his part o the isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue
sir this should be answerd
tis done already and the messenger gone
i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquerd i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquerd kingdoms i demand the like
hell never yield to that
nor must not then be yielded to in this
hail caesar and my lord
hail most dear caesar
that ever i should call thee castaway
you have not calld me so nor have you cause
why have you stoln upon us thus
you come not like caesars sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by the way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a marketmaid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting
good my lord to come thus was i not constraind but did on my free will
my lord mark antony hearing that you prepared for war acquainted my grieved ear withal whereon i beggd his pardon for return
which soon he granted being an obstruct tween his lust and him
do not say so my lord
i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind
where is he now
my lord in athens
no my most wronged sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her
he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o the earth for war he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia philadelphos king of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas king malchus of arabia king of pont herod of jewry mithridates king of comagene polemon and amyntas the kings of mede and lycaonia with a more larger list of sceptres
ay me most wretched that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that do afflict each other
welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger
cheer your heart be you not troubled with the time which drives oer your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewaild their way
welcome to rome nothing more dear to me
you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice make them ministers of us and those that love you
best of comfort and ever welcome to us
welcome lady
welcome dear madam
each heart in rome does love and pity you only the adulterous antony most large in his abominations turns you off and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us
is it so sir
most certain
sister welcome pray you be ever known to patience my dearst sister
i will be even with thee doubt it not
but why why why
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and sayst it is not fit
well is it is it
if not denounced against us why should not we be there in person
none if we should serve with horse and mares together the horse were merely lost the mares would bear a soldier and his horse
what ist you say
your presence needs must puzzle antony take from his heart take from his brain froms time what should not then be spared
he is already traduced for levity and tis said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war
sink rome and their tongues rot that speak against us
a charge we bear i the war and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man
speak not against it i will not stay behind
nay i have done
here comes the emperor
is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne
you have heard ont sweet
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent
a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness
canidius we will fight with him by sea
by sea
what else
why will my lord do so
for that he dares us tot
so hath my lord dared him to single fight
ay and to wage this battle at pharsalia
where caesar fought with pompey but these offers which serve not for his vantage be shakes off and so should you
your ships are not well mannd your mariners are muleters reapers people ingrossd by swift impress in caesars fleet are those that often have gainst pompey fought their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea being prepared for land
by sea by sea
most worthy sir you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land distract your army which doth most consist of warmarkd footmen leave unexecuted your own renowned knowledge quite forego the way which promises assurance and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard from firm security
ill fight at sea
i have sixty sails caesar none better
our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest fullmannd from the head of actium beat the approaching caesar
but if we fail we then can dot at land
thy business
the news is true my lord he is descried caesar has taken toryne
can he be there in person
tis impossible strange that power should be
canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse
well to our ship away my thetis
how now worthy soldier
o noble emperor do not fight by sea trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds
let the egyptians and the phoenicians go aducking we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot
well well away
by hercules i think i am i the right
soldier thou art but his whole action grows not in the power ont so our leaders led and we are womens men
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole do you not
marcus octavius marcus justeius publicola and caelius are for sea but we keep whole by land
this speed of caesars carries beyond belief
while he was yet in rome his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies
whos his lieutenant hear you
they say one taurus
well i know the man
the emperor calls canidius
with news the times with labour and throes forth each minute some
taurus
my lord
strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea
do not exceed the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies upon this jump
set we our squadrons on yond side o the hill in eye of caesars battle from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly
naught naught all naught
i can behold no longer the antoniad the egyptian admiral with all their sixty fly and turn the rudder to seet mine eyes are blasted
gods and goddesses all the whole synod of them
whats thy passion
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance we have kissd away kingdoms and provinces
how appears the fight
on our side like the tokend pestilence where death is sure
yon ribaudred nag of egypt whom leprosy oertakei the midst o the fight when vantage like a pair of twins appeard both as the same or rather ours the elder the breese upon her like a cow in june hoists sails and flies
that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view
she once being loofd the noble ruin of her magic antony claps on his seawing and like a doting mallard leaving the fight in height flies after her i never saw an action of such shame experience manhood honour neer before did violate so itself
alack alack
our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably
had our general been what he knew himself it had gone well o he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own
ay are you thereabouts
why then good night indeed
toward peloponnesus are they fled
tis easy tot and there i will attend what further comes
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse six kings already show me the way of yielding
ill yet follow the wounded chance of antony though my reason sits in the wind against me
hark
the land bids me tread no more upont it is ashamed to bear me
friends come hither i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way for ever i have a ship laden with gold take that divide it fly and make your peace with caesar
fly
not we
i have fled myself and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders
friends be gone i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you be gone my treasures in the harbour take it
o i followd that i blush to look upon my very hairs do mutiny for the white reprove the brown for rashness and they them for fear and doting
friends be gone you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you
pray you look not sad nor make replies of loathness take the hint which my despair proclaims let that be left which leaves itself to the seaside straightway i will possess you of that ship and treasure
leave me i pray a little pray you now nay do so for indeed i have lost command therefore i pray you ill see you by and by
nay gentle madam to him comfort him
do most dear queen
do
why what else
let me sit down
o juno
no no no no no
see you here sir
o fie fie fie
madam
madam o good empress
sir sir yes my lord yes he at philippi kept his sword een like a dancer while i struck the lean and wrinkled cassius and twas i that the mad brutus ended he alone dealt on lieutenantry and no practise had in the brave squares of war yet nowno matter
ah stand by
the queen my lord the queen
go to him madam speak to him he is unqualitied with very shame
well then sustain him o
most noble sir arise the queen approaches her heads declined and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue
i have offended reputation a most unnoble swerving
sir the queen
o whither hast thou led me egypt
see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind stroyd in dishonour
o my lord my lord forgive my fearful sails
i little thought you would have followd
egypt thou knewst too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings and thou shouldst tow me after oer my spirit thy full supremacy thou knewst and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me
o my pardon
now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o the world playd as i pleased making and marring fortunes
you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause
pardon pardon
fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss even this repays me
we sent our schoolmaster is he come back
love i am full of lead
some wine within there and our viands
fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows
let him appear thats come from antony
know you him
caesar tis his schoolmaster an argument that he is pluckd when hither he sends so poor a pinion off his wing which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by
approach and speak
such as i am i come from antony i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morndew on the myrtleleaf to his grand sea
bet so declare thine office
lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and requires to live in egypt which not granted he lessens his requests and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in athens this for him
next cleopatra does confess thy greatness submits her to thy might and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs now hazarded to thy grace
for antony i have no ears to his request
the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her alldisgraced friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard
so to them both
fortune pursue thee
bring him through the bands
none from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the neer touchd vestal try thy cunning thyreus make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law
caesar i go
observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou thinkst his very action speaks in every power that moves
caesar i shall
what shall we do enobarbus
think and die
is antony or we in fault for this
antony only that would make his will lord of his reason
what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other
why should he follow
the itch of his affection should not then have nickd his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the meered question twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing
prithee peace
is that his answer
ay my lord
the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up
he says so
let her knowt
to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities
that head my lord
to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a cowards whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i the command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone
ill write it follow me
none unstate his happiness and be staged to the show against a sworder
i see mens judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike
that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness
caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too
a messenger from caesar
what no more ceremony
see my women
against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneeld unto the buds
admit him sir
none the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a falln lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i the story
caesars will
hear it apart
none but friends say boldly
so haply are they friends to antony
he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us
if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesars
so
thus then thou most renownd caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou standst further than he is caesar
go on right royal
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love but as you feard him
o
the scars upon your honour therefore he does pity as constrained blemishes not as deserved
he is a god and knows what is most right mine honour was not yielded but conquerd merely
none i will ask antony
sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee
shall i say to caesar what you require of him
for he partly begs to be desired to give
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left antony and put yourself under his shrowd the universal landlord
whats your name
my name is thyreus
most kind messenger say to great caesar this in deputation i kiss his conquering hand tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at s feet and there to kneel tell him from his allobeying breath i hear the doom of egypt
tis your noblest course
wisdom and fortune combating together if that the former dare but what it can no chance may shake it
give me grace to lay my duty on your hand
your caesars father oft when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in bestowd his lips on that unworthy place as it raind kisses
favours by jove that thunders
what art thou fellow
one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man and worthiest to have command obeyd
none approach there
ah you kite
now gods and devils
authority melts from me of late when i cried ho
like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry your will
have you no ears
i am antony yet
take hence this jack and whip him
none than with an old one dying
moon and stars
whip him
weret twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she herewhats her name since she was cleopatra
whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy take him hence
mark antony
tug him away being whippd bring him again this jack of caesars shall bear us an errand to him
you were half blasted ere i knew you ha
have i my pillow left unpressd in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race and by a gem of women to be abused by one that looks on feeders
good my lord you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard o misery ontthe wise gods seel our eyes in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh ats while we strut to our confusion
o ist come to this
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesars trencher nay you were a fragment of cneius pompeys besides what hotter hours unregisterd in vulgar fame you have luxuriously pickd out for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is
wherefore is this
to let a fellow that will take rewards and say god quit you
be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts
o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horned herd
for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a halterd neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him
is he whippd
soundly my lord
cried he
and beggd a pardon
he did ask favour
if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whippd for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on t
get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy tis to dot when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into the abysm of hell
if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes begone
have you done yet
alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony
i must stay his time
to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points
not know me yet
coldhearted toward me
ah dear if i be so from my cold heart let heaven engender hail and poison it in the source and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines so dissolve my life
the next caesarion smite
till by degrees the memory of my womb together with my brave egyptians all by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey
i am satisfied
caesar sits down in alexandria where i will oppose his fate
our force by land hath nobly held our severd navy too have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike
where hast thou been my heart
dost thou hear lady
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips i will appear in blood i and my sword will earn our chronicle theres hope int yet
thats my brave lord
i will be treblesinewd hearted breathed and fight maliciously for when mine hours were nice and lucky men did ransom lives of me for jests but now ill set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me
come lets have one other gaudy night call to me all my sad captains fill our bowls once more lets mock the midnight bell
it is my birthday i had thought to have held it poor but since my lord is antony again i will be cleopatra
we will yet do well
call all his noble captains to my lord
do so well speak to them and tonight ill force the wine peep through their scars
come on my queen theres sap int yet
the next time i do fight ill make death love me for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe
now hell outstare the lightning
to be furious is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge and i see still a diminution in our captains brain restores his heart when valour preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with
i will seek some way to leave him
he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt my messenger he hath whippd with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge
caesar must think when one so great begins to rage hes hunted even to falling
give him no breath but now make boot of his distraction never anger made good guard for itself
let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in
see it done and feast the army we have store to dot and they have earnd the waste
poor antony
he will not fight with me domitius
no
why should he not
he thinks being twenty times of better fortune he is twenty men to one
tomorrow soldier by sea and land ill fight or i will live or bathe my dying honour in the blood shall make it live again
woot thou fight well
ill strike and cry take all
well said come on
call forth my household servants lets tonight be bounteous at our meal
give me thy hand thou hast been rightly honestso hast thou thouand thouand thouyou have served me well and kings have been your fellows
none none tricks which sorrow shoots out of the mind
and thou art honest too
i wish i could be made so many men and all of you clappd up together in an antony that i might do you service so good as you have done
the gods forbid
well my good fellows wait on me tonight scant not my cups and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too and sufferd my command
none none tend me tonight may be it is the period of your duty haply you shall not see me more or if a mangled shadow perchance tomorrow youll serve another master
i look on you as one that takes his leave
mine honest friends i turn you not away but like a master married to your good service stay till death tend me tonight two hours i ask no more and the gods yield you fort
what mean you sir to give them this discomfort
look they weep and i an ass am onioneyed for shame transform us not to women

grace grow where those drops fall
my hearty friends you take me in too dolorous a sense for i spake to you for your comfort did desire you to burn this night with torches know my hearts i hope well of tomorrow and will lead you where rather ill expect victorious life than death and honour

he goes forth gallantly
that he and caesar might determine this great war in single fight
then antonybut nowwell on
the gods make this a happy day to antony
would thou and those thy scars had once prevaild to make me fight at land
hadst thou done so the kings that have revolted and the soldier that has this morning left thee would have still followd thy heels
whos gone this morning
who
one ever near thee call for enobarbus he shall not hear thee or from caesars camp say i am none of thine
what sayst thou
sir he is with caesar
sir his chests and treasure he has not with him
is he gone
most certain
go eros send his treasure after do it detain no jot i charge thee write to him i will subscribegentle adieus and greetings say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master
o my fortunes have corrupted honest men

go forth agrippa and begin the fight our will is antony be took alive make it so known
caesar i shall
the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosperous day the threenookd world shall bear the olive freely
antony is come into the field
go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the van that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself
alexas did revolt and went to jewry on affairs of antony there did persuade great herod to incline himself to caesar and leave his master antony for this pains caesar hath hangd him
canidius and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honourable trust
i have done ill of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more
enobarbus antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure with his bounty overplus the messenger came on my guard and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules
i give it you
mock not enobarbus
i tell you true best you safed the bringer out of the host i must attend mine office or would have donet myself
your emperor continues still a jove
i am alone the villain of the earth and feel i am so most
o antony thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid my better service when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold
this blows my heart if swift thought break it not a swifter mean shall outstrike thought but thought will dot i feel
i fight against thee
no i will go seek some ditch wherein to die the foulst best fits my latter part of life
retire we have engaged ourselves too far caesar himself has work and our oppression exceeds what we expected
o my brave emperor this is fought indeed
had we done so at first we had droven them home with clouts about their heads
thou bleedst apace
i had a wound here that was like a t but now tis made an h they do retire
well beat em into benchholes i have yet room for six scotches more
they are beaten sir and our advantage serves for a fair victory
let us score their backs and snatch em up as we take hares behind tis sport to maul a runner
i will reward thee once for thy spritely comfort and tenfold for thy good valour
come thee on
ill halt after
we have beat him to his camp run one before and let the queen know of our gests
tomorrow before the sun shall see s well spill the blood that has today escaped
i thank you all for doughtyhanded are you and have fought not as you served the cause but as t had been each mans like mine you have shown all hectors
enter the city clip your wives your friends tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss the honourd gashes whole
give me thy hand to this great fairy ill commend thy acts make her thanks bless thee
o thou day o the world chain mine armd neck leap thou attire and all through proof of harness to my heart and there ride on the pants triumphing
lord of lords
o infinite virtue comest thou smiling from the worlds great snare uncaught
my nightingale we have beat them to their beds
what girl
though grey do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth
behold this man commend unto his lips thy favouring hand kiss it my warrior he hath fought today as if a god in hate of mankind had destroyd in such a shape
ill give thee friend an armour all of gold it was a kings
he has deserved it were it carbuncled like holy phoebus car
give me thy hand through alexandria make a jolly march bear our hackd targets like the men that owe them had our great palace the capacity to camp this host we all would sup together and drink carouses to the next days fate which promises royal peril
trumpeters with brazen din blast you the citys ear make mingle with rattling tabourines that heaven and earth may strike their sounds together applauding our approach
if we be not relieved within this hour we must return to the court of guard the night is shiny and they say we shall embattle by the second hour i the morn
this last day was a shrewd one tos
o bear me witness night what man is this
stand close and list him
be witness to me o thou blessed moon when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory poor enobarbus did before thy face repent
enobarbus
peace
hark further
o sovereign mistress of true melancholy the poisonous damp of night disponge upon me that life a very rebel to my will may hang no longer on me throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault which being dried with grief will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts
o antony nobler than my revolt is infamous forgive me in thine own particular but let the world rank me in register a masterleaver and a fugitive o antony
o antony
lets speak to him
lets hear him for the things he speaks may concern caesar
lets do so
but he sleeps
swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep
go we to him
awake sir awake speak to us
hear you sir
the hand of death hath raught him
hark
the drums demurely wake the sleepers
let us bear him to the court of guard he is of note our hour is fully out
come on then he may recover yet
their preparation is today by sea we please them not by land
for both my lord
i would theyld fight i the fire or i the air weld fight there too
but this it is our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city shall stay with us order for sea is given they have put forth the haven where their appointment we may best discover and look on their endeavour
but being charged we will be still by land which as i taket we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys
to the vales and hold our best advantage
yet they are not joind where yond pine does stand i shall discover all ill bring thee word straight how tis like to go
swallows have built in cleopatras sails their nests the augurers say they know not they cannot tell look grimly and dare not speak their knowledge
antony is valiant and dejected and by starts his fretted fortunes give him hope and fear of what he has and has not
all is lost this foul egyptian hath betrayed me my fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder they cast their caps up and carouse together like friends long lost
tripleturnd whore
tis thou hast sold me to this novice and my heart makes only wars on thee
bid them all fly for when i am revenged upon my charm i have done all
bid them all fly begone
o sun thy uprise shall i see no more fortune and antony part here even here do we shake hands
all come to this
the hearts that spanield me at heels to whom i gave their wishes do discandy melt their sweets on blossoming caesar and this pine is barkd that overtoppd them all
betrayd i am o this false soul of egypt
this grave charm whose eye beckd forth my wars and calld them home whose bosom was my crownet my chief end like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose beguiled me to the very heart of loss
what eros eros
ah thou spell
avaunt
why is my lord enraged against his love
vanish or i shall give thee thy deserving and blemish caesars triumph
let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians follow his chariot like the greatest spot of all thy sex most monsterlike be shown for poorst diminutives for doits and let patient octavia plough thy visage up with her prepared nails
tis well thourt gone if it be well to live but better twere thou fellst into my fury for one death might have prevented many
eros ho
the shirt of nessus is upon me teach me alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage let me lodge lichas on the horns o the moon and with those hands that graspd the heaviest club subdue my worthiest self
the witch shall die to the young roman boy she hath sold me and i fall under this plot she dies fort
eros ho
help me my women
o he is more mad than telamon for his shield the boar of thessaly was never so embossd
to the monument
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead
the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off
to the monument
mardian go tell him i have slain myself say that the last i spoke was antony and word it prithee piteously hence mardian and bring me how he takes my death
to the monument
eros thou yet beholdst me
ay noble lord
sometimes we see a cloud thats dragonish a vapour sometime like a bear or lion a towerd citadel a pendent rock a forked mountain or blue promontory with trees upont that nod unto the world and mock our eyes with air thou hast seen these signs they are black vespers pageants
ay my lord that which is now a horse even with a thought the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct as water is in water
it does my lord
my good knave eros now thy captain is even such a body here i am antony yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
i made these wars for egypt and the queen whose heart i thought i had for she had mine which whilst it was mine had annexd untot a million more now lostshe eros has packd cards with caesar and falseplayd my glory unto an enemys triumph
nay weep not gentle eros there is left us ourselves to end ourselves
o
thy vile lady
she has robbd me of my sword
no antony my mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled with thine entirely
hence saucy eunuch peace
she hath betrayd me and shall die the death
death of one person can be paid but once and that she has discharged what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand the last she spake was antony
most noble antony
then in the midst a tearing groan did break the name of antony it was divided between her heart and lips she renderd life thy name so buried in her
dead then
dead
unarm eros the long days task is done and we must sleep
that thou departst hence safe does pay thy labour richly go
off pluck off the sevenfold shield of ajax cannot keep the battery from my heart
o cleave my sides

apace eros apace
no more a soldier bruised pieces go you have been nobly borne
from me awhile
i will oertake thee cleopatra and weep for my pardon
so it must be for now all length is torture since the torch is out lie down and stray no farther now all labour mars what it does yea very force entangles itself with strength seal then and all is done

come eros eros
what would my lord
since cleopatra died i have lived in such dishonour that the gods detest my baseness
i that with my sword quarterd the world and oer green neptunes back with ships made cities condemn myself to lack the courage of a woman less noble mind than she which by her death our caesar tells i am conqueror of myself
thou art sworn eros that when the exigent should come which now is come indeed when i should see behind me the inevitable prosecution of disgrace and horror that on my command thou then wouldst kill me dot the time is come thou strikest not me tis caesar thou defeatst
put colour in thy cheek
the gods withhold me
shall i do that which all the parthian darts though enemy lost aim and could not
eros wouldst thou be windowd in great rome and see thy master thus with pleachd arms bending down his corrigible neck his face subdued to penetrative shame whilst the wheeld seat of fortunate caesar drawn before him branded his baseness that ensued
i would not seet
come then for with a wound i must be cured
draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn most useful for thy country
o sir pardon me
when i did make thee free sworest thou not then to do this when i bade thee
do it at once or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed
draw and come
turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies
lo thee
my sword is drawn
then let it do at once the thing why thou hast drawn it
my dear master my captain and my emperor let me say before i strike this bloody stroke farewell
tis said man and farewell
farewell great chief
shall i strike now
now eros
why there then thus i do escape the sorrow of antonys death
thricenobler than myself
thou teachest me o valiant eros what i should and thou couldst not
my queen and eros have by their brave instruction got upon me a nobleness in record but i will be a bridegroom in my death and run intot as to a lovers bed
come then and eros thy master dies thy scholar to do thus i learnd of thee

most absolute lord my mistress cleopatra sent me to thee
when did she send thee

i am dying egypt dying give me some wine and let me speak a little
no let me speak and let me rail so high that the false housewife fortune break her wheel provoked by my offence
one word sweet queen of caesar seek your honour with your safety
o
they do not go together
gentle hear me none about caesar trust but proculeius
my resolution and my hands ill trust none about caesar
the miserable change now at my end lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts in feeding them with those my former fortunes wherein i lived the greatest prince o the world the noblest and do now not basely die not cowardly put off my helmet to my countrymana roman by a roman valiantly vanquishd
now my spirit is going i can no more
noblest of men woot die
hast thou no care of me
shall i abide in this dull world which in thy absence is no better than a sty
o see my women the crown o the earth doth melt
my lord
o witherd is the garland of the war the soldiers pole is falln young boys and girls are level now with men the odds is gone and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon
o quietness lady
she is dead too our sovereign
lady
madam
o madam madam madam
royal egypt empress
peace peace iras
no more but een a woman and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares
it were for me to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had stoln our jewel
alls but naught patience is scottish and impatience does become a dog thats mad then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death ere death dare come to us
how do you women
what what
good cheer
why how now charmian
my noble girls
ah women women look our lamp is spent its out
good sirs take heart well bury him and then whats brave whats noble lets do it after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us
come away this case of that huge spirit now is cold ah women women
come we have no friend but resolution and the briefest end
go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes
caesar i shall
wherefore is that
and what art thou that darest appear thus to us
i am calld dercetas mark antony i served who best was worthy best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke he was my master and i wore my life to spend upon his haters
if thou please to take me to thee as i was to him ill be to caesar if thou pleasest not i yield thee up my life
what ist thou sayst
i say o caesar antony is dead
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world
he is dead caesar not by a public minister of justice nor by a hired knife but that self hand which writ his honour in the acts it did hath with the courage which the heart did lend it splitted the heart
this is his sword i robbd his wound of it behold it staind with his most noble blood
look you sad friends
the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings
and strange it is that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds
his taints and honours waged equal with him
a rarer spirit never did steer humanity but you gods will give us some faults to make us men
caesar is touchd
when such a spacious mirrors set before him he needs must see himself
o antony
i have followd thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindlethat our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this
hear me good friends but i will tell you at some meeter season the business of this man looks out of him well hear him what he says
whence are you
a poor egyptian yet
the queen my mistress confined in all she has her monument of thy intents desires instruction that she preparedly may frame herself to the way shes forced to
bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honourable and how kindly we determine for her for caesar cannot live to be ungentle
so the gods preserve thee
come hither proculeius
go and say we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her
caesar i shall
gallus go you along
wheres dolabella to second proculeius
dolabella
let him alone for i remember now how hes employd he shall in time be ready
go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this
my desolation does begin to make a better life
tis paltry to be caesar not being fortune hes but fortunes knave a minister of her will and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds which shackles accidents and bolts up change which sleeps and never palates more the dug the beggars nurse and caesars
caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt and bids thee study on what fair demands thou meanst to have him grant thee
whats thy name
my name is proculeius
antony did tell me of you bade me trust you but i do not greatly care to be deceived that have no use for trusting
if your master would have a queen his beggar you must tell him that majesty to keep decorum must no less beg than a kingdom if he please to give me conquerd egypt for my son he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks
be of good cheer youre falln into a princely hand fear nothing make your full reference freely to my lord who is so full of grace that it flows over on all that need let me report to him your sweet dependency and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeld to
pray you tell him i am his fortunes vassal and i send him the greatness he has got
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience and would gladly look him i the face
this ill report dear lady
have comfort for i know your plight is pitied of him that caused it
you see how easily she may be surprised guard her till caesar come
royal queen
o cleopatra
thou art taken queen quick quick good hands
hold worthy lady hold do not yourself such wrong who are in this relieved but not betrayd
what of death too that rids our dogs of languish
cleopatra do not abuse my masters bounty by the undoing of yourself let the world see his nobleness well acted which your death will never let come forth
where art thou death
come hither come
come come and take a queen worthy many babes and beggars
o temperance lady
sir i will eat no meat ill not drink sir if idle talk will once be necessary ill not sleep neither this mortal house ill ruin do caesar what he can
know sir that i will not wait piniond at your masters court nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me
rather on nilus mud lay me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring
rather make my countrys high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar
proculeius what thou hast done thy master caesar knows and he hath sent for thee for the queen ill take her to my guard
so dolabella it shall content me best be gentle to her
to caesar i will speak what you shall please if youll employ me to him
say i would die
most noble empress you have heard of me
i cannot tell
assuredly you know me
no matter sir what i have heard or known
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ist not your trick
i understand not madam
i dreamd there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man
if it might please ye his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth
most sovereign creature his legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder
for his bounty there was no winter int an autumn twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphinlike they showd his back above the element they lived in in his livery walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates droppd from his pocket
cleopatra
think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamd of
gentle madam no
you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be or ever were one such its past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine and antony were natures piece gainst fancy condemning shadows quite
hear me good madam
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it as answering to the weight would i might never oertake pursued success but i do feel by the rebound of yours a grief that smites my very heart at root
i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
nay pray you sir though he be honourable hell lead me then in triumph
madam he will i knowt
which is the queen of egypt
it is the emperor madam
arise you shall not kneel i pray you rise rise egypt
sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey
take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance
sole sir o the world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex
cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antonys course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which ill guard them from if thereon you rely
ill take my leave
and may through all the world tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please
here my good lord
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessd of tis exactly valued not petty things admitted
wheres seleucus
here madam
this is my treasurer let him speak my lord upon his peril that i have reserved to myself nothing
speak the truth seleucus
madam i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not
what have i kept back
enough to purchase what you have made known
nay blush not cleopatra i approve your wisdom in the deed
see caesar
o behold how pomp is followd
mine will now be yours and should we shift estates yours would be mine
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild o slave of no more trust than love thats hired
what goest thou back
thou shalt go back i warrant thee but ill catch thine eyes though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
o rarely base
good queen let us entreat you
o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy
say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred
the gods
it smites me beneath the fall i have
prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me
forbear seleucus
be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others merits in our name are therefore to be pitied
cleopatra not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i the roll of conquest still bet yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesars no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold
therefore be cheerd make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel
feed and sleep our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend and so adieu
my master and my lord
not so
adieu
he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself but hark thee charmian
finish good lady the bright day is done and we are for the dark
hie thee again i have spoke already and it is provided go put it to the haste
madam i will
where is the queen
behold sir
dolabella
madam as thereto sworn by your command which my love makes religion to obey i tell you this caesar through syria intends his journey and within three days you with your children will he send before make your best use of this i have performd your pleasure and my promise
dolabella i shall remain your debtor
i your servant adieu good queen i must attend on caesar
farewell and thanks
now iras what thinkst thou
thou an egyptian puppet shalt be shown in rome as well as i mechanic slaves with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall uplift us to the view in their thick breaths rank of gross diet shall be enclouded and forced to drink their vapour
the gods forbid
nay tis most certain iras saucy lictors will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers ballad us out o tune the quick comedians extemporally will stage us and present our alexandrian revels antony shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness i the posture of a whore
o the good gods
nay thats certain
ill never see t for i am sure my nails are stronger than mine eyes
why thats the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents
now charmian
show me my women like a queen go fetch my best attires i am again for cydnus to meet mark antony sirrah iras go
now noble charmian well dispatch indeed and when thou hast done this chare ill give thee leave to play till doomsday
bring our crown and all
wherefores this noise
here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your highness presence he brings you figs
let him come in
what poor an instrument may do a noble deed
he brings me liberty
my resolutions placed and i have nothing of woman in me now from head to foot i am marbleconstant now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine
this is the man
avoid and leave him
hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there that kills and pains not
truly i have him but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or never recover
rememberest thou any that have died ont
very many men and women too
i heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes a very good report o the worm but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do but this is most fallible the worms an odd worm
get thee hence farewell
i wish you all joy of the worm
farewell
you must think this look you that the worm will do his kind
ay ay farewell
look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in worm
take thou no care it shall be heeded
very good
give it nothing i pray you for it is not worth the feeding
will it eat me
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not
but truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar five
well get thee gone farewell
yes forsooth i wish you joy o the worm
give me my robe put on my crown i have immortal longings in me now no more the juice of egypts grape shall moist this lip yare yare good iras quick
methinks i hear antony call i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act i hear him mock the luck of caesar which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath husband i come now to that name my courage prove my title
i am fire and air my other elements i give to baser life
so have you done
come then and take the last warmth of my lips
farewell kind charmian iras long farewell
have i the aspic in my lips
dost fall
if thou and nature can so gently part the stroke of death is as a lovers pinch which hurts and is desired
dost thou lie still
if thus thou vanishest thou tellst the world it is not worth leavetaking
dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say the gods themselves do weep
this proves me base if she first meet the curled antony hell make demand of her and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have
come thou mortal wretch with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch
o couldst thou speak that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied
o eastern star
peace peace
dost thou not see my baby at my breast that sucks the nurse asleep
o break
o break
as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle o antonynay i will take thee too
what should i stay in this vile world
so fare thee well
now boast thee death in thy possession lies a lass unparalleld
downy windows close and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal
your crowns awry ill mend it and then play
where is the queen
speak softly wake her not
caesar hath sent too slow a messenger
o come apace dispatch
i partly feel thee
approach ho
alls not well caesars beguiled
theres dolabella sent from caesar call him
what work is here
charmian is this well done
it is well done and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings
ah soldier
how goes it here
all dead
caesar thy thoughts touch their effects in this thyself art coming to see performd the dreaded act which thou so soughtst to hinder
o sir you are too sure an augurer that you did fear is done
bravest at the last she levelld at our purposes and being royal took her own way
the manner of their deaths
i do not see them bleed
who was last with them
a simple countryman that brought her figs this was his basket
poisond then
o caesar this charmian lived but now she stood and spake i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood and on the sudden droppd
o noble weakness
if they had swallowd poison twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace
here on her breast there is a vent of blood and something blown the like is on her arm
this is an aspics trail and these figleaves have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves upon the caves of nile
most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die
take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous
high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral and then to rome
come dolabella see high order in this great solemnity
now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow this old moon wanes
she lingers my desires like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man revenue
four days will quickly steep themselves in night four nights will quickly dream away the time and then the moon like to a silver bow newbent in heaven shall behold the night of our solemnities
go philostrate stir up the athenian youth to merriments awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth turn melancholy forth to funerals the pale companion is not for our pomp
hippolyta i wood thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries but i will wed thee in another key with pomp with triumph and with revelling
happy be theseus our renowned duke
thanks good egeus whats the news with thee
full of vexation come i with complaint against my child my daughter hermia
stand forth demetrius
my noble lord this man hath my consent to marry her
stand forth lysander and my gracious duke this man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchanged lovetokens with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardend youth with cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart turnd her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case
what say you hermia
be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it
demetrius is a worthy gentleman
so is lysander
in himself he is but in this kind wanting your fathers voice the other must be held the worthier
i would my father lookd but with my eyes
rather your eyes must with his judgment look
i do entreat your grace to pardon me
i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius
either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men
therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your fathers choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewd to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
thriceblessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilld than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness
so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty
take time to pause and by the nest new moon the sealingday betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your fathers will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on dianas altar to protest for aye austerity and single life
relent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazed title to my certain right
you have her fathers love demetrius let me have hermias do you marry him
scornful lysander
true he hath my love and what is mine my love shall render him
and she is mine and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius
i am my lord as well derived as he as well possessd my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly rankd if not with vantage as demetrius and which is more than all these boasts can be i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right
demetrius ill avouch it to his head made love to nedars daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man
i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being overfull of selfaffairs my mind did lose it
but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both
for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your fathers will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life
come my hippolyta what cheer my love
demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves
with duty and desire we follow you
how now my love
why is your cheek so pale
how chance the roses there do fade so fast
belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
ay me
for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood o cross
too high to be enthralld to low
or else misgraffed in respect of years o spite
too old to be engaged to young
or else it stood upon the choice of friends o hell
to choose love by anothers eyes
or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold
the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion
if then true lovers have been ever crossd it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancys followers
a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son
there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us
if thou lovest me then steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee
my good lysander
i swear to thee by cupids strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee
keep promise love
look here comes helena
god speed fair helena
whither away
call you me fair
that fair again unsay
demetrius loves your fair o happy fair
your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody
were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest id give to be to you translated
o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart
i frown upon him yet he loves me still
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
i give him curses yet he gives me love
o that my prayers could such affection move
the more i hate the more he follows me
the more i love the more he hateth me
his folly helena is no fault of mine
none but your beauty would that fault were mine
take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place
before the time i did lysander see seemd athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell
helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers flights doth still conceal through athens gates have we devised to steal
and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies
farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight
i will my hermia
helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you
how happy some oer other some can be
through athens i am thought as fair as she
but what of that
demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermias eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile folding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind nor hath loves mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius lookd on hermias eyne he haild down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
i will go tell him of fair hermias flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again
is all our company here
you were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip
here is the scroll of every mans name which is thought fit through all athens to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his weddingday at night
first good peter quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point
marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby
a very good piece of work i assure you and a merry
now good peter quince call forth your actors by the scroll
masters spread yourselves
answer as i call you
nick bottom the weaver
ready
name what part i am for and proceed
you nick bottom are set down for pyramus
what is pyramus
a lover or a tyrant
a lover that kills himself most gallant for love
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it if i do it let the audience look to their eyes i will move storms i will condole in some measure
to the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split
the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates and phibbus car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates
this was lofty
now name the rest of the players
this is ercles vein a tyrants vein a lover is more condoling
francis flute the bellowsmender
here peter quince
flute you must take thisby on you
what is thisby
a wandering knight
it is the lady that pyramus must love
nay faith let me not play a woman i have a beard coming
thats all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will
an i may hide my face let me play thisby too ill speak in a monstrous little voice
thisne thisne ah pyramus lover dear
thy thisby dear and lady dear
no no you must play pyramus and flute you thisby
well proceed
robin starveling the tailor
here peter quince
robin starveling you must play thisbys mother
tom snout the tinker
here peter quince
you pyramus father myself thisbys father snug the joiner you the lions part and i hope here is a play fitted
have you the lions part written
pray you if it be give it me for i am slow of study
you may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring
let me play the lion too i will roar that i will do any mans heart good to hear me i will roar that i will make the duke say let him roar again let him roar again
an you should do it too terribly you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all
that would hang us every mothers son
i grant you friends if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove i will roar you an twere any nightingale
you can play no part but pyramus for pyramus is a sweetfaced man a proper man as one shall see in a summers day a most lovely gentlemanlike man therefore you must needs play pyramus
well i will undertake it
what beard were i best to play it in
why what you will
i will discharge it in either your strawcolour beard your orangetawny beard your purpleingrain beard or your frenchcrowncolour beard your perfect yellow
some of your french crowns have no hair at all and then you will play barefaced
but masters here are your parts and i am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company and our devices known
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants
i pray you fail me not
we will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously
take pains be perfect adieu
at the dukes oak we meet
enough hold or cut bowstrings
how now spirit
whither wander you
over hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier over park over pale thorough flood thorough fire i do wander everywhere swifter than the moons sphere and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green
the cowslips tall her pensioners be in their gold coats spots you see those be rubies fairy favours in those freckles live their savours i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslips ear
farewell thou lob of spirits ill be gone our queen and all our elves come here anon
the king doth keep his revels here tonight take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorncups and hide them there
either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite calld robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he
thou speakst aright i am that merry wanderer of the night
i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossips bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her witherd dewlap pour the ale
the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there
but room fairy
here comes oberon
and here my mistress
would that he were gone
ill met by moonlight proud titania
what jealous oberon
fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company
tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida
why art thou here come from the farthest steppe of india
but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskind mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity
how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus
didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravished
and make him with fair aegle break his faith with ariadne and antiopa
these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summers spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by paved fountain or by rushy brook or in the beached margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport
therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suckd up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard the fold stands empty in the drowned field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine mens morris is filld up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original
do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon
i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman
set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me
his mother was a votaress of my order and in the spiced indian air by night full often hath she gossipd by my side and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughd to see the sails conceive and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait followingher womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise
but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him
how long within this wood intend you stay
perchance till after theseus weddingday
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
give me that boy and i will go with thee
not for thy fairy kingdom
fairies away
we shall chide downright if i longer stay
well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury
my gentle puck come hither
thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the seamaids music
i remember
that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armd a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupids fiery shaft quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votaress passed on in maiden meditation fancyfree
yet markd i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milkwhite now purple with loves wound and maidens call it loveinidleness
fetch me that flower the herb i shewd thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees
fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league
ill put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes
having once this juice ill watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb ill make her render up her page to me
but who comes here
i am invisible and i will overhear their conference
i love thee not therefore pursue me not
where is lysander and fair hermia
the one ill slay the other slayeth me
thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood and here am i and wode within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia
hence get thee gone and follow me no more
you draw me you hardhearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you
do i entice you
do i speak you fair
or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
and even for that do i love you the more
i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you
what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee
and i am sick when i look not on you
you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity
your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me
ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
the wildest hath not such a heart as you
run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valour flies
i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief
fie demetrius
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we cannot fight for love as men may do we should be wood and were not made to woo
ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well
fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
hast thou the flower there
welcome wanderer
ay there it is
i pray thee give it me
i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lulld in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enamelld skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this ill streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies
take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on
effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
fear not my lord your servant shall do so
come now a roundel and a fairy song then for the third part of a minute hence some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds some war with reremice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits
sing me now asleep then to your offices and let me rest
you spotted snakes with double tongue thorny hedgehogs be not seen newts and blindworms do no wrong come not near our fairy queen
philomel with melody sing in our sweet lullaby lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby never harm nor spell nor charm come our lovely lady nigh so good night with lullaby
weaving spiders come not here hence you longleggd spinners hence
beetles black approach not near worm nor snail do no offence
philomel with melody c hence away
now all is well one aloof stand sentinel
what thou seest when thou dost wake do it for thy truelove take love and languish for his sake be it ounce or cat or bear pard or boar with bristled hair in thy eye that shall appear when thou wakest it is thy dear wake when some vile thing is near
fair love you faint with wandering in the wood and to speak troth i have forgot our way well rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day
be it so lysander find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near
o take the sense sweet of my innocence
love takes the meaning in loves conference
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchained with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth
then by your side no bedroom me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie
lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied
but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end
amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty
here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
with half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd
through the forest have i gone
but athenian found i none on whose eyes i might approve this flowers force in stirring love
night and silencewho is here
weeds of athens he doth wear this is he my master said despised the athenian maid and here the maiden sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul
she durst not lie near this lacklove this killcourtesy
churl upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe
when thou wakest let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid so awake when i am gone for i must now to oberon
stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
o wilt thou darkling leave me
do not so
stay on thy peril i alone will go
o i am out of breath in this fond chase
the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
happy is hermia wheresoeer she lies for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
how came her eyes so bright
not with salt tears if so my eyes are oftener washd than hers
no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermias sphery eyne
but who is here
lysander
on the ground
dead
or asleep
i see no blood no wound
lysander if you live good sir awake
none transparent helena
nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
where is demetrius
o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword
do not say so lysander say not so what though he love your hermia
lord what though
yet hermia still loves you then be content
content with hermia
no i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent
not hermia but helena i love who will not change a raven for a dove
the will of man is by his reason swayd and reason says you are the worthier maid
things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i oerlook loves stories written in loves richest book
wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
ist not enough ist not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye but you must flout my insufficiency
good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo
but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness
o that a lady of one man refused
should of another therefore be abused
she sees not hermia
hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as tie heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me
and all my powers address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight
none to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
ay me for pity
what a dream was here
lysander look how i do quake with fear methought a serpent eat my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel pray
lysander
what removed
lysander
lord
what out of hearing
gone
no sound no word
alack where are you speak an if you hear speak of all loves
i swoon almost with fear
no
then i well perceive you all not nigh either death or you ill find immediately
are we all met
pat pat and heres a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal
this green plot shall be our stage this hawthornbrake our tiringhouse and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
peter quince what sayest thou bully bottom
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisby that will never please
first pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide
how answer you that
byr lakin a parlous fear
i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
not a whit i have a device to make all well
write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear
well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six
no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
i fear it i promise you
masters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring ingod shield usa lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to look to t
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lions neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defectladiesor fairladiesi would wish youor i would request youor i would entreat younot to fear not to tremble my life for yours
if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner
well it shall be so
but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight
doth the moon shine that night we play our play
a calendar a calendar
look in the almanac find out moonshine find out moonshine
yes it doth shine that night
why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement
ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine
then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wall
you can never bring in a wall
what say you bottom
some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisby whisper
if that may be then all is well
come sit down every mothers son and rehearse your parts
pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue
what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here so near the cradle of the fairy queen
what a play toward
ill be an auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause
speak pyramus
thisby stand forth
thisby the flowers of odious savours sweet odours odours
odours savours sweet so hath thy breath my dearest thisby dear
but hark a voice
stay thou but here awhile and by and by i will to thee appear
a stranger pyramus than eer played here
must i speak now
ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
most radiant pyramus most lilywhite of hue of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew as true as truest horse that yet would never tire ill meet thee pyramus at ninnys tomb
ninus tomb man why you must not speak that yet that you answer to pyramus you speak all your part at once cues and all pyramus enter your cue is past it is never tire
oas true as truest horse that yet would never tire
if i were fair thisby i were only thine
o monstrous
o strange
we are haunted
pray masters
fly masters
help
ill follow you ill lead you about a round through bog through bush through brake through brier sometime a horse ill be sometime a hound a hog a headless bear sometime a fire and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
why do they run away
this is a knavery of them to make me afeard
o bottom thou art changed
what do i see on thee
what do you see
you see an asshead of your own do you
bless thee bottom
bless thee
thou art translated
i see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could
but i will not stir from this place do what they can i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid
the ousel cock so black of hue with orangetawny bill the throstle with his note so true the wren with little quill none none the finch the sparrow and the lark the plainsong cuckoo gray whose note full many a man doth mark and dares not answer nay for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo never so
i pray thee gentle mortal sing again mine ear is much enamourd of thy note so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape and thy fair virtues force perforce doth move me on the first view to say to swear i love thee
methinks mistress you should have little reason for that and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends
nay i can gleek upon occasion
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
out of this wood do not desire to go thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
i am a spirit of no common rate the summer still doth tend upon my state and i do love thee therefore go with me ill give thee fairies to attend on thee and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go
peaseblossom
cobweb
moth
and mustardseed
ready
and i and i and i where shall we go
be kind and courteous to this gentleman hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes feed him with apricocks and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries the honeybags steal from the humblebees and for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glowworms eyes to have my love to bed and to arise and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes nod to him elves and do him courtesies
hail mortal
hail
hail
hail
i cry your worships mercy heartily i beseech your worships name

good master peaseblossom i shall desire you of more acquaintance too

mustardseed
good master mustardseed i know your patience well that same cowardly giantlike oxbeef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house i promise you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now
i desire your more acquaintance good master mustardseed
come wait upon him lead him to my bower
the moon methinks looks with a watery eye and when she weeps weeps every little flower lamenting some enforced chastity
tie up my loves tongue bring him silently
i wonder if titania be awaked then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity
here comes my messenger
how now mad spirit
what nightrule now about this haunted grove
my mistress with a monster is in love
near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus nuptialday
the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enterd in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an asss nole i fixed on his head anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimic comes
when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russetpated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the guns report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here oer and oer one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls
their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania waked and straightway loved an ass
this falls out better than i could devise
but hast thou yet latchd the athenians eyes with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do
i took him sleepingthat is finishd too and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed
stand close this is the same athenian
this is the woman but not this the man
o why rebuke you him that loves you so
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia
ill believe as soon this whole earth may be bored and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brothers noontide with antipodes
it cannot be but thou hast murderd him so should a murderer look so dead so grim
so should the murderd look and so should i pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
whats this to my lysander
where is he
ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
out dog
out cur
thou drivest me past the bounds of maidens patience
hast thou slain him then
henceforth be never numberd among men
o once tell true tell true even for my sake
durst thou have lookd upon him being awake and hast thou killd him sleeping
o brave touch
could not a worm an adder do so much
an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung
you spend your passion on a misprised mood i am not guilty of lysanders blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell
i pray thee tell me then that he is well
an if i could what should i get therefore
a privilege never to see me more
and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no
there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain
so sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay
what hast thou done
thou hast mistaken quite and laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turnd and not a false turnd true
then fate oerrules that one man holding troth a million fail confounding oath on oath
about the wood go swifter than the wind and helena of athens look thou find all fancysick she is and pale of cheer with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear by some illusion see thou bring her here ill charm his eyes against she do appear
i go i go look how i go swifter than arrow from the tartars bow
flower of this purple dye hit with cupids archery sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky
when thou wakest if she be by beg of her for remedy
captain of our fairy band helena is here at hand and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lovers fee
shall we their fond pageant see
lord what fools these mortals be
stand aside the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake
then will two at once woo one that must needs be sport alone and those things do best please me that befal preposterously
why should you think that i should woo in scorn
scorn and derision never come in tears look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears
how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
you do advance your cunning more and more
when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray
these vows are hermias will you give her oer
weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales
i had no judgment when to her i swore
nor none in my mind now you give her oer
demetrius loves her and he loves not you
none to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
crystal is muddy
o how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
that pure congealed white high taurus snow fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou holdst up thy hand o let me kiss this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
o spite
o hell
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment if you we re civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury
can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too
if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts
you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes with your derision
none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor souls patience all to make you sport
you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know and here with all good will with all my heart in hermias love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do till my death
never did mockers waste more idle breath
lysander keep thy hermia i will none if eer i loved her all that love is gone
my heart to her but as guestwise sojournd and now to helen is it home returnd there to remain
helen it is not so
disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense
thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
why should he stay whom love doth press to go
what love could press lysander from my side
lysanders love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
why seekst thou me
could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so
you speak not as you think it cannot be
lo she is one of this confederacy
now i perceive they have conjoind all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me
injurious hermia
most ungrateful maid
have you conspired have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision
is all the counsel that we two have shared the sisters vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hastyfooted time for parting uso is it all forgot
all schooldays friendship childhood innocence
we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate
so we grow together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crowned with one crest
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend
it is not friendly tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury
i am amazed at your passionate words
i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face
and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates
and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent
what thought i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved
this you should pity rather than despise
i understand not what you mean by this
ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled
if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument
but fare ye well tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy
stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena
o excellent
sweet do not scorn her so
if she cannot entreat i can compel
thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
helen i love thee by my life i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not
i say i love thee more than he can do
if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
quick come
lysander whereto tends all this
away you ethiope
no no hell seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go
hang off thou cat thou burr
vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
why are you grown so rude
what change is this
sweet love thy love
out tawny tartar out
out loathed medicine
hated potion hence
do you not jest
yes sooth and so do you
demetrius i will keep my word with thee
i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word
what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
although i hate her ill not harm her so
what can you do me greater harm than hate
hate me
wherefore
o me
what news my love
am not i hermia
are not you lysander
i am as fair now as i was erewhile
since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left meo the gods forbid in earnest shall i say
ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more
therefore be out of hope of question of doubt be certain nothing truer tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena
o me
you juggler
you cankerblossom
you thief of love
what have you come by night and stolen my loves heart from him
fine ifaith
have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness
what will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue
fie fie
you counterfeit you puppet you
puppet
why so
ay that way goes the game
now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him
and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low
how low am i thou painted maypole
speak how low am i
i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me
you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her
lower
hark again
good hermia do not be so bitter with me
i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood
he followd you for love i followd him but he hath chid me hence and threatend me to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too and now so you will let me quiet go to athens will i bear my folly back and follow you no further let me go you see how simple and how fond i am
why get you gone who ist that hinders you
a foolish heart that i leave here behind
what with lysander
with demetrius
be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
no sir she shall not though you take her part
o when shes angry she is keen and shrewd
she was a vixen when she went to school and though she be but little she is fierce
little again
nothing but low and little
why will you suffer her to flout me thus
let me come to her
get you gone you dwarf you minimus of hindering knotgrass made you bead you acorn
you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services
let her alone speak not of helena take not her part for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her thou shalt aby it
now she holds me not now follow if thou darest to try whose right of thine or mine is most in helena
follow
nay ill go with thee cheek by jole
you mistress all this coil is long of you nay go not back
i will not trust you i nor longer stay in your curst company
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray my legs are longer though to run away
i am amazed and know not what to say
this is thy negligence still thou mistakest or else committst thy knaveries wilfully
believe me king of shadows i mistook
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment be had on
and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have nointed an athenians eyes and so far am i glad it so did sort as this their jangling i esteem a sport
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight hie therefore robin overcast the night the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within anothers way
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong and sometime rail thou like demetrius and from each other look thou lead them thus till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep then crush this herb into lysanders eye whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
when they next wake all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision and back to athens shall the lovers wend with league whose date till death shall never end
whiles i in this affair do thee employ ill to my queen and beg her indian boy and then i will her charmed eye release from monsters view and all things shall be peace
my fairy lord this must be done with haste for nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast and yonder shines auroras harbinger at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there troop home to churchyards damned spirits all that in crossways and floods have burial already to their wormy beds are gone for fear lest day should look their shames upon they willfully themselves exile from light and must for aye consort with blackbrowd night
but we are spirits of another sort i with the mornings love have oft made sport and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fieryred opening on neptune with fair blessed beams turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
but notwithstanding haste make no delay we may effect this business yet ere day
up and down up and down i will lead them up and down i am feard in field and town goblin lead them up and down
here comes one
where art thou proud demetrius
speak thou now
here villain drawn and ready
where art thou
i will be with thee straight
follow me then to plainer ground
lysander
speak again thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
speak
in some bush
where dost thou hide thy head
thou coward art thou bragging to the stars telling the bushes that thou lookst for wars and wilt not come
come recreant come thou child ill whip thee with a rod he is defiled that draws a sword on thee
yea art thou there
follow my voice well try no manhood here
he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls then he is gone
the villain is much lighterheeld than i i followd fast but faster he did fly that fallen am i in dark uneven way and here will rest me
come thou gentle day
for if but once thou show me thy grey light ill find demetrius and revenge this spite
ho ho ho
coward why comest thou not
abide me if thou darest for well i wot thou runnst before me shifting every place and darest not stand nor look me in the face
where art thou now
come hither i am here
nay then thou mockst me
thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see now go thy way
faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed
by days approach look to be visited
o weary night o long and tedious night abate thy hour
shine comforts from the east that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrows eye steal me awhile from mine own company
yet but three
come one more two of both kinds make up four
here she comes curst and sad cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad
never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires
here will i rest me till the break of day
heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray
on the ground sleep sound ill apply to your eye gentle lover remedy
when thou wakest thou takest true delight in the sight of thy former ladys eye and the country proverb known that every man should take his own in your waking shall be shown jack shall have jill nought shall go ill the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well
come sit thee down upon this flowery bed while i thy amiable cheeks do coy and stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head and kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy
wheres peaseblossom
ready
scratch my head peaseblossom
wheres mounsieur cobweb
ready
mounsieur cobweb good mounsieur get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a redhipped humblebee on the top of a thistle and good mounsieur bring me the honeybag
do not fret yourself too much in the action mounsieur and good mounsieur have a care the honeybag break not i would be loath to have you overflown with a honeybag signior
wheres mounsieur mustardseed
ready
give me your neaf mounsieur mustardseed
pray you leave your courtesy good mounsieur
whats your will
nothing good mounsieur but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch
i must to the barbers monsieur for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face and i am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me i must scratch
what wilt thou hear some music my sweet love
i have a reasonable good ear in music
lets have the tongs and the bones
or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
truly a peck of provender i could munch your good dry oats
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay good hay sweet hay hath no fellow
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrels hoard and fetch thee new nuts
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas
but i pray you let none of your people stir me i have an exposition of sleep come upon me
sleep thou and i will wind thee in my arms
fairies begone and be all ways away
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm
o how i love thee
how i dote on thee
none seest thou this sweet sight
her dotage now i do begin to pity for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms beggd my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land
and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and gentle puck take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this nights accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream
but first i will release the fairy queen
be as thou wast wont to be see as thou wast wont to see dians bud oer cupids flower hath such force and blessed power
now my titania wake you my sweet queen
my oberon
what visions have i seen
methought i was enamourd of an ass
there lies your love
how came these things to pass
o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
silence awhile
robin take off this head
titania music call and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense
music ho
music such as charmeth sleep
now when thou wakest with thine own fools eyes peep
sound music
come my queen take hands with me and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
now thou and i are new in amity and will tomorrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus house triumphantly and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded with theseus all in jollity
fairy king attend and mark i do hear the morning lark
then my queen in silence sad trip we after the nights shade we the globe can compass soon swifter than the wandering moon
come my lord and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground
go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is performd and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds
uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester
we will fair queen up to the mountains top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction
i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayd the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemd all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewd so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlappd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells each under each
a cry more tuneable was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear
but soft
what nymphs are these
my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedars helena i wonder of their being here together
no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity
but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice
it is my lord
go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
good morrow friends
saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now
pardon my lord
i pray you all stand up
i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i thinkfor truly would i speak and now do i bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law
enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head
they would have stolen away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife
my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followd them fair helena in fancy following me
but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it ismy love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena
to her my lord was i betrothd ere i saw hermia but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it
fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon
egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside
away with us to athens three and three well hold a feast in great solemnity
come hippolyta
these things seem small and undistinguishable methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double
so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own
are you sure that we are awake
it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream
do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him
yea and my father
and hippolyta
and he did bid us follow to the temple
why then we are awake lets follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams
none answer my next is most fair pyramus
heighho
peter quince
flute the bellowsmender
snout the tinker
starveling
gods my life stolen hence and left me asleep
i have had a most rare vision
i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream
methought i wasthere is no man can tell what
methought i wasand methought i hadbut man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had
the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen mans hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was
i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called bottoms dream because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death
have you sent to bottoms house
is he come home yet
he cannot be heard of
out of doubt he is transported
if he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth it
it is not possible you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he
no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens
yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice
you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us a thing of naught
masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men
o sweet bully bottom
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus ill be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus or nothing
where are these lads
where are these hearts
bottom
o most courageous day
o most happy hour
masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if i tell you i am no true athenian
i will tell you every thing right as it fell out
let us hear sweet bottom
not a word of me
all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined
get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look oer his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred
in any case let thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails for they shall hang out for the lions claws
and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy
no more words away
go away
tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of
more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys
lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends
the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name
such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear
but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancys images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable
here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
joy gentle friends
joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts
more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed
come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our aftersupper and bedtime
where is our usual manager of mirth
what revels are in hand
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
call philostrate
here mighty theseus
say what abridgement have you for this evening
what masque
what music
how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight
there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first
none by an athenian eunuch to the harp
well none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules
the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage
that is an old device and it was playd when i from thebes came last a conqueror
the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary
that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth
merry and tragical
tedious and brief
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
how shall we find the concord of this discord
a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself
which when i saw rehearsed i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed
what are they that do play it
hardhanded men that work in athens here which never labourd in their minds till now and now have toild their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial
and we will hear it
no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain to do you service
i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it
go bring them in and take your places ladies
i love not to see wretchedness oer charged and duty in his service perishing
why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
he says they can do nothing in this kind
the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit
where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome
trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pickd a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tonguetied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity
so please your grace the prologue is addressd
let him approach
if we offend it is with our good will
that you should think we come not to offend but with good will
to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end
consider then we come but in despite
we do not come as minding to contest you our true intent is
all for your delight we are not here
that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know
this fellow doth not stand upon points
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop
a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true
indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government
his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered
who is next
gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain
this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisby is certain
this man with lime and roughcast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through walls chink poor souls they are content to whisper
at the which let no man wonder
this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo
this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisby coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisbys mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broachd is boiling bloody breast and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died
for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain
i wonder if the lion be to speak
no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisby did whisper often very secretly
this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
would you desire lime and hair to speak better
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord
pyramus draws near the wall silence
o grimlookd night
o night with hue so black
o night which ever art when day is not
o night o night
alack alack alack i fear my thisbys promise is forgot
and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that standst between her fathers ground and mine
thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
but what see i
no thisby do i see
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
no in truth sir he should not
deceiving me is thisbys cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall
you shall see it will fall pat as i told you
yonder she comes
o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me
my cherry lips have often kissd thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisbys face
thisby
my love thou art my love i think
think what thou wilt i am thy lovers grace and like limander am i trusty still
and i like helen till the fates me kill
not shafalus to procrus was so true
as shafalus to procrus i to you
o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
i kiss the walls hole not your lips at all
wilt thou at ninnys tomb meet me straightway
tide life tide death i come without delay
thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go
now is the mural down between the two neighbours
no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them
it must be your imagination then and not theirs
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men
here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
then know that i one snug the joiner am a lionfell nor else no lions dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity on my life
a very gentle beast of a good conscience
the very best at a beast my lord that eer i saw
this lion is a very fox for his valour
true and a goose for his discretion
not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose
his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox
it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present he should have worn the horns on his head
he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the man i the moon do seem to be
this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn
how is it else the man i the moon
he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff
i am aweary of this moon would he would change
it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time
proceed moon
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon
but silence
here comes thisbe
this is old ninnys tomb
where is my love
none well roared lion
well run thisbe
well shone moon
truly the moon shines with a good grace
well moused lion
and so the lion vanished
and then came pyramus
sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams i trust to take of truest thisby sight
but stay o spite
but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here
eyes do you see
how can it be
o dainty duck
o dear
thy mantle good what staind with blood
approach ye furies fell
o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail crush conclude and quell
this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad
beshrew my heart but i pity the man
o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear which isno nowhich was the fairest dame that lived that loved that liked that lookd with cheer
come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop thus die i thus thus thus
now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky tongue lose thy light moon take thy flight now die die die die die
no die but an ace for him for he is but one
less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass
how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover
she will find him by starlight
here she comes and her passion ends the play
methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief
a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
and thus she means videlicet asleep my love
what dead my dove
o pyramus arise
speak speak
quite dumb
dead dead
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes
these my lips this cherry nose these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone are gone lovers make moan his eyes were green as leeks
o sisters three come come to me with hands as pale as milk lay them in gore since you have shore with shears his thread of silk
tongue not a word come trusty sword come blade my breast imbrue and farewell friends thus thisby ends adieu adieu adieu
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
ay and wall too
none parted their fathers
will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company
no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse
never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed
marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged
but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatchd
this palpablegross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night
sweet friends to bed
a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity
now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy ploughman snores all with weary task fordone
now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screechowl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud
now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the churchway paths to glide and we fairies that do run by the triple hecates team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallowd house i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door
through the house give gathering light by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly
first rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place
now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray
to the best bridebed will we which by us shall blessed be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate
so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of natures hand shall not in their issue stand never mole hare lip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despised in nativity shall upon their children be
with this fielddew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest
trip away make no stay meet me all by break of day
if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumberd here while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend and as i am an honest puck if we have unearned luck now to scape the serpents tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call so good night unto you all
give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends
whos there

horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it
tush tush twill not appear
sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen
well sit we down and let us hear bernardo speak of this
last night of all when yond same star thats westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one peace break thee off look where it comes again
in the same figure like the king thats dead
thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
looks it not like the king
mark it horatio
most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
it would be spoke to
question it horatio
what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march
by heaven i charge thee speak
it is offended
see it stalks away
stay
speak speak
i charge thee speak
tis gone and will not answer
how now horatio
you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy
what think you ont
before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes
is it not like the king
as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
tis strange
thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state
good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me
that can i at least the whisper goes so
our last king whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet
now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and romage in the land
i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars
a mote it is to trouble the minds eye
in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen but soft behold
lo where it comes again
ill cross it though it blast me
stay illusion
if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak
stop it marcellus
shall i strike at it with my partisan
do if it will not stand
tis here
tis here
tis gone
we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery
it was about to speak when the cock crew
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons
i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation
it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time
so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty
lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently
though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves
therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along
for all our thanks
now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother
so much for him
now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephews purposeto suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated articles allow
farewell and let your haste commend your duty
in that and all things will we show our duty
we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
and now laertes whats the news with you
you told us of some suit what ist laertes
you cannot speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father
what wouldst thou have laertes
my dread lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
have you your fathers leave
what says polonius
he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go
take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin hamlet and my son none how is it that the clouds still hang on you
not so my lord i am too much i the sun
good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
ay madam it is common
if it be why seems it so particular with thee
seems madam
nay it is i know not seems
tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe
tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart
fie
tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so
we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you
for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
i shall in all my best obey you madam
why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark
madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again respeaking earthly thunder
come away
o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew
or that the everlasting had not fixd his canon gainst selfslaughter
o god
god
how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world
fie ont
ah fie
tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely
that it should come to this
but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly
heaven and earth
must i remember
why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followd my poor fathers body like niobe all tearswhy she even she o god
a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mournd longermarried with my uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married
o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
hail to your lordship
i am glad to see you well horatioor i do forget myself
the same my lord and your poor servant ever
sir my good friend ill change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio
marcellus
my good lord i am very glad to see you
good even sir
but what in faith make you from wittenberg
a truant disposition good my lord
i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do mine ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant
but what is your affair in elsinore
well teach you to drink deep ere you depart
my lord i came to see your fathers funeral
i pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent i think it was to see my mothers wedding
indeed my lord it followd hard upon
thrift thrift horatio
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio
my fathermethinks i see my father
where my lord
in my minds eye horatio
i saw him once he was a goodly king
he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
my lord i think i saw him yesternight
saw
who
my lord the king your father
the king my father
season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you
for gods love let me hear
two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounterd
a figure like your father armed at point exactly capape appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him
this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like
but where was this
my lord upon the platform where we watchd
did you not speak to it
my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight
tis very strange
as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it
indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
hold you the watch tonight
we do my lord
armd say you
armd my lord
from top to toe
my lord from head to foot
then saw you not his face
o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
what lookd he frowningly
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
pale or red
nay very pale
and fixd his eyes upon you
most constantly
i would i had been there
it would have much amazed you
very like very like
stayd it long
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
longer longer
not when i sawt
his beard was grizzledno
it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd
i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again
i warrant it will
if it assume my noble fathers person ill speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace
i pray you all if you have hitherto conceald this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves
so fare you well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve ill visit you
our duty to your honour
your loves as mine to you farewell
my fathers spirit in arms
all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come
till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes
my necessaries are embarkd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you
do you doubt that
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more
no more but so
think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal
perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head
then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart
but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede
o fear me not
i stay too long but here my father comes
a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave
yet here laertes
aboard aboard for shame
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd for
there my blessing with thee
and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character
give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledged comrade
beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee
most humbly do i take my leave my lord
the time invites you go your servants tend
farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you
tis in my memory lockd and you yourself shall keep the key of it
farewell
what ist ophelia be hath said to you
so please you something touching the lord hamlet
marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour
what is between you
give me up the truth
he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me
affection
pooh
you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them
i do not know my lord what i should think
marry ill teach you think yourself a baby that you have taen these tenders for true pay which are not sterling
tender yourself more dearly ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thusyoull tender me a fool
my lord he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion
ay fashion you may call it go to go to
and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven
ay springes to catch woodcocks
i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is amaking you must not take for fire
from this time be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley
for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile
this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look tot i charge you come your ways
i shall obey my lord
the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
it is a nipping and an eager air
what hour now
i think it lacks of twelve
no it is struck
indeed
i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
what does this mean my lord
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge
is it a custom
ay marry ist but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance
this heavyheaded revel east and west makes us traduced and taxd of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute
so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birthwherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes star their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal
look my lord it comes
angels and ministers of grace defend us
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me
let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonized bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again
what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
say why is this
wherefore
what should we do
it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone
look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it
no by no means
it will not speak then i will follow it
do not my lord
why what should be the fear
i do not set my life in a pins fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself
it waves me forth again ill follow it
what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles oer his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness
think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath
it waves me still
go on ill follow thee
you shall not go my lord
hold off your hands
be ruled you shall not go
my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lions nerve
still am i calld
unhand me gentlemen
by heaven ill make a ghost of him that lets me
i say away
go on ill follow thee
he waxes desperate with imagination
lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him
have after
to what issue will this come
something is rotten in the state of denmark
heaven will direct it
nay lets follow him
where wilt thou lead me
speak ill go no further
mark me
i will
my hour is almost come when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render up myself
alas poor ghost
pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold
speak i am bound to hear
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
what
i am thy fathers spirit doomd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood
list list o list
if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
murder
murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural
haste me to knowt that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge
i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this
now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy fathers life now wears his crown
o my prophetic soul
my uncle
ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seducewon to his shameful lust the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen o hamlet what a fallingoff was there
from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine
but virtue as it never will be moved though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel linkd will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage
but soft
methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be
sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter barkd about most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhouseld disappointed unaneld no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible
o horrible
most horrible
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoever thou pursuest this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her
fare thee well at once
the glowworm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual fire adieu adieu
hamlet remember me
o all you host of heaven
o earth
what else
and shall i couple hell
o fie
hold hold my heart and you my sinews grow not instant old but bear me stiffly up
remember thee
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe
remember thee
yea from the table of my memory ill wipe away all trivial fond records all saws of books all forms all pressures past that youth and observation copied there and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain unmixd with baser matter yes by heaven
o most pernicious woman
o villain villain smiling damned villain
my tablesmeet it is i set it down that one may smile and smile and be a villain at least im sure it may be so in denmark so uncle there you are

ay very well my lord
and in part him but you may say not well but ift be he i mean hes very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty
as gaming my lord
ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far
my lord that would dishonour him
faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault
but my good lord wherefore should you do this
ay my lord i would know that
marry sir heres my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soild i the working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country
very good my lord

by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave
at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman
at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such or such and as you say there was a gaming there oertook ins rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth
see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son
you have me have you not
my lord i have
god be wi you fare you well
good my lord
observe his inclination in yourself
i shall my lord
and let him ply his music
well my lord
farewell
how now ophelia
whats the matter
o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted
with what i the name of god
my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings fould ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrorshe comes before me
mad for thy love
my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it
what said he
he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it
long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me
come go with me i will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures
i am sorry
what have you given him any hard words of late
no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his fetters and denied his access to me
that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion
come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love
welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern
moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending
something have you heard of hamlets transformation so call it sith nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was
what it should be more than his fathers death that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opend lies within our remedy
good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres
if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a kings remembrance
both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty
but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded
thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern
thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son
go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
heavens make our presence and our practises pleasant and helpful to him
ay amen
the ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully returnd
thou still hast been the father of good news
have i my lord
i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlets lunacy
o speak of that that do i long to hear
give first admittance to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast
thyself do grace to them and bring them in
he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your sons distemper
i doubt it is no other but the main his fathers death and our oerhasty marriage
well we shall sift him
welcome my good friends
say voltimand what from our brother norway
most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephews levies which to him appeard to be a preparation gainst the polack but better lookd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down
it likes us well and at our more considerd time well read answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your welltook labour go to your rest at night well feast together most welcome home
this business is well ended
my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what ist but to be nothing else but mad
but let that go
more matter with less art
madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art
mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus
perpend
i have a daughterhave while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise
to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified ophelia thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear
thus in her excellent white bosom these c came this from hamlet to her
good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love
o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it
adieu
thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet
this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear
but how hath she received his love
what do you think of me
as of a man faithful and honourable
i would fain prove so
but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told mewhat might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or tablebook or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think
no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulseda short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for
do you think tis this
it may be very likely
hath there been such a timeid fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise
not that i know
none take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre
how may we try it further
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby
so he does indeed
at such a time ill loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason falln thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters
we will try it
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
away i do beseech you both away ill board him presently
o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet
well godamercy
do you know me my lord
excellent well you are a fishmonger
not i my lord
then i would you were so honest a man
honest my lord
ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand
thats very true my lord
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a god kissing carrionhave you a daughter
i have my lord
let her not walk i the sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
friend look to t
none daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this
ill speak to him again
what do you read my lord
words words words
what is the matter my lord
between who
i mean the matter that you read my lord
slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward
none in t
will you walk out of the air my lord
into my grave
indeed that is out o the air
how pregnant sometimes his replies are
a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of
i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
fare you well my lord
these tedious old fools
you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
none my honoured lord
my most dear lord
my excellent good friends
how dost thou guildenstern
ah rosencrantz
good lads how do ye both
as the indifferent children of the earth
happy in that we are not overhappy on fortunes cap we are not the very button
nor the soles of her shoe
neither my lord
then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours
faith her privates we
in the secret parts of fortune
o most true she is a strumpet
whats the news
none my lord but that the worlds grown honest
then is doomsday near but your news is not true
let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither
prison my lord
denmarks a prison
then is the world one
a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst
we think not so my lord
why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison
why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind
o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
a dream itself is but a shadow
truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow
then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows
shall we to the court
for by my fay i cannot reason
well wait upon you
no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended
but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore
to visit you my lord no other occasion
beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny
were you not sent for
is it your own inclining
is it a free visitation
come deal justly with me come come nay speak
what should we say my lord
why any thing but to the purpose
you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you
to what end my lord
that you must teach me
but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no
none none love me hold not off
my lord we were sent for
i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather
i have of latebut wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
what a piece of work is a man
how noble in reason
how infinite in faculty
in form and moving how express and admirable
in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god
the beauty of the world
the paragon of animals
and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust
man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me
to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort
what players are they
even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city
how chances it they travel
their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city
are they so followed
no indeed are they not
how comes it
do they grow rusty
nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither
what are they children
who maintains em
how are they escoted
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing
will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question
ist possible
o there has been much throwing about of brains
do the boys carry it away
ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty an hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
there are the players
gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore
your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours
you are welcome but my unclefather and auntmother are deceived
in what my dear lord
i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw
well be with you gentlemen
hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddlingclouts
happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it
you say right sir o monday morning twas so indeed
my lord i have news to tell you
my lord i have news to tell you
when roscius was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord
buz buz
upon mine honour then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragical comicalhistoricalpastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light
for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men
o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou
what a treasure had he my lord
why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well
none am i not i the right old jephthah
if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well
nay that follows not
what follows then my lord
why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgement comes
you are welcome masters welcome all
i am glad to see thee well
welcome good friends
o my old friend
thy face is valenced since i saw thee last comest thou to beard me in denmark
what my young lady and mistress
byr lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine
pray god your voice like apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring
masters you are all welcome
well een tot like french falconers fly at any thing we see well have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech
what speech my lord
i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it wasas i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning
i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine
one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast it is not soit begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus oersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks
so proceed you
fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion
anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls
then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo
his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing
but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new awork and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam
out out thou strumpet fortune
all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends
this is too long
it shall to the barbers with your beard
prithee say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba
but who o who had seen the mobled queen the mobled queen
thats good mobled queen is good
run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all oerteemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods
look whether he has not turned his colour and has tears ins eyes
pray you no more
tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon
good my lord will you see the players well bestowed
do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live
my lord i will use them according to their desert
gods bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping
use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
take them in
come sirs
follow him friends well hear a play tomorrow
dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago
ay my lord
well hat tomorrow night
you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert int could you not
ay my lord
very well
follow that lord and look you mock him not
my good friends ill leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore
good my lord
ay so god be wi ye now i am alone
o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wannd tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit
and all for nothing
for hecuba
whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her
what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have
he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears
yet i a dull and muddymettled rascal peak like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat was made
am i a coward
who calls me villain
breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose
gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs
who does me this
ha
swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
o vengeance
why what an ass am i
this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall acursing like a very drab a scullion
fie upont
foh
about my brain
i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course
the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king
and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak
nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state
did he receive you well
most like a gentleman
but with much forcing of his disposition
niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply
did you assay him
to any pastime
madam it so fell out that certain players we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him
tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter
with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined
good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights
we shall my lord
sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for
i shall obey you
and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours
madam i wish it may
ophelia walk you here
gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves
read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness
we are oft to blame in this tis too much provedthat with devotions visage and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself
none how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen
i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd
to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of despised love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin
who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of actionsoft you now
the fair ophelia
nymph in thy orisons be all my sins rememberd
good my lord how does your honour for this many a day
i humbly thank you well well well
my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver i pray you now receive them
no not i i never gave you aught
my honourd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
there my lord
ha ha
are you honest
my lord
are you fair
what means your lordship
that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty
could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof
i did love you once
indeed my lord you made me believe so
you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not
i was the more deceived
get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners
i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven
we are arrant knaves all believe none of us
go thy ways to a nunnery
wheres your father
at home my lord
let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool no where but ins own house
farewell
o help him you sweet heavens
if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny
get thee to a nunnery go farewell
or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
to a nunnery go and quickly too
farewell
o heavenly powers restore him
i have heard of your paintings too well enough god has given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance
go to ill no more ont it hath made me mad
i say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are
to a nunnery go
o what a noble mind is here oerthrown
the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all observers quite quite down
and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suckd the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatchd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see
love
his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness
theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this somethingsettled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself
what think you ont
it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love
how now ophelia
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all
my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and ill be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference
if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think
it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go
speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the towncrier spoke my lines
nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness
o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it
i warrant your honour
be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special oerstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure
now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others
o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir
o reform it altogether
and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it
go make you ready
how now my lord
i will the king hear this piece of work
and the queen too and that presently
bid the players make haste
will you two help to hasten them
we will my lord
what ho
horatio
here sweet lord at your service
horatio thou art een as just a man as eer my conversation coped withal
o my dear lord nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee
why should the poor be flatterd
no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning
dost thou hear
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath seald thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortunes buffets and rewards hast taen with equal thanks and blest are those whose blood and judgment are so well commingled that they are not a pipe for fortunes finger to sound what stop she please
give me that man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core ay in my heart of heart as i do theesomething too much of this there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my fathers death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcans stithy
give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming
well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and scape detecting i will pay the theft
they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place
how fares our cousin hamlet
excellent i faith of the chameleons dish i eat the air promisecrammed you cannot feed capons so
i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine
no nor mine now
my lord you played once i the university you say
that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor
what did you enact
i did enact julius caesar i was killed i the capitol brutus killed me
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there
be the players ready
ay my lord they stay upon your patience
come hither my dear hamlet sit by me
no good mother heres metal more attractive
none lady shall i lie in your lap
no my lord
i mean my head upon your lap
ay my lord
do you think i meant country matters
i think nothing my lord
thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs
what is my lord
nothing
you are merry my lord
who i
ay my lord
o god your only jigmaker
what should a man do but be merry
for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within these two hours
nay tis twice two months my lord
so long
nay then let the devil wear black for ill have a suit of sables
o heavens
die two months ago and not forgotten yet
then theres hope a great mans memory may outlive his life half a year but byr lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobbyhorse whose epitaph is for o for o the hobbyhorse is forgot
what means this my lord
marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief
belike this show imports the argument of the play
we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel theyll tell all
will he tell us what this show meant
ay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamed to show hell not shame to tell you what it means
you are naught you are naught ill mark the play
for us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
tis brief my lord
as womans love
full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground and thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred bands
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count oer ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust you
yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for womens fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity
now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is sized my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there
faith i must leave thee love and shortly too my operant powers their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honourd beloved and haply one as kind for husband shalt thou o confound the rest
such love must needs be treason in my breast in second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who killd the first
none the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed
i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break
purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanced makes friends of enemies
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
sport and repose lock from me day and night
to desperation turn my trust and hope
an anchors cheer in prison be my scope
each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife
if she should break it now
tis deeply sworn
sweet leave me here awhile my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleep
sleep rock thy brain and never come mischance between us twain
madam how like you this play
the lady protests too much methinks
o but shell keep her word
have you heard the argument
is there no offence in t
no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i the world
what do you call the play
the mousetrap
marry how
tropically
this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the dukes name his wife baptista you shall see anon tis a knavish piece of work but what o that
your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung
this is one lucianus nephew to the king
you are as good as a chorus my lord
i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying
you are keen my lord you are keen
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
still better and worse
so you must take your husbands
begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin
come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge
thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing confederate season else no creature seeing thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected with hecates ban thrice blasted thrice infected thy natural magic and dire property on wholesome life usurp immediately
he poisons him i the garden fors estate
his names gonzago the story is extant and writ in choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzagos wife
the king rises
what frighted with false fire
how fares my lord
give oer the play
give me some light away
lights lights lights
why let the stricken deer go weep the hart ungalled play for some must watch while some must sleep so runs the world away
would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with mewith two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir
half a share
a whole one i for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very verypajock
you might have rhymed
o good horatio ill take the ghosts word for a thousand pound
didst perceive
very well my lord
upon the talk of the poisoning
i did very well note him
ah ha
come some music
come the recorders
for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdy
come some music
good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
sir a whole history
the king sir ay sir what of him
is in his retirement marvellous distempered
with drink sir
no my lord rather with choler
your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler
good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair
i am tame sir pronounce
the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you
you are welcome
nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer i will do your mothers commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business
sir i cannot
what my lord
make you a wholesome answer my wits diseased but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration
o wonderful son that can so astonish a mother
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mothers admiration
impart
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
we shall obey were she ten times our mother
have you any further trade with us
my lord you once did love me
so i do still by these pickers and stealers
good my lord what is your cause of distemper
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend
sir i lack advancement
how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark
ay but sir while the grass growsthe proverb is something musty
o the recorders
let me see one
to withdraw with youwhy do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil
o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly
i do not well understand that
will you play upon this pipe
my lord i cannot
i pray you
believe me i cannot
i do beseech you
i know no touch of it my lord
tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
look you these are the stops
but these cannot i command to any utterance of harmony i have not the skill
why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me
you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak
sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe
call me what instrument you will though you can fret me yet you cannot play upon me
god bless you sir
my lord the queen would speak with you and presently
do you see yonder cloud thats almost in shape of a camel
by the mass and tis like a camel indeed
methinks it is like a weasel
it is backed like a weasel
or like a whale
very like a whale
then i will come to my mother by and by
they fool me to the top of my bent
i will come by and by
i will say so
by and by is easily said
leave me friends
tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on
soft
now to my mother
o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words soever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent
i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range
therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies
we will ourselves provide most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many
the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw whats near it with it it is a massy wheel fixd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoind which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boisterous ruin
never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan
arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too freefooted
we will haste us
my lord hes going to his mothers closet behind the arras ill convey myself to hear the process and warrant shell tax him home and as you said and wisely was it said tis meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should oerhear the speech of vantage
fare you well my liege ill call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know
thanks dear my lord
o my offence is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upont a brothers murder
pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow
whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence
and whats in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardond being down
then ill look up my fault is past
but o what form of prayer can serve my turn
forgive me my foul murder
that cannot be since i am still possessd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardond and retain the offence
in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelld even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence
what then
what rests
try what repentance can what can it not
yet what can it when one can not repent
o wretched state
o bosom black as death
o limed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged
help angels
make assay
bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
all may be well
now might i do it pat now he is praying and now ill dot
and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged
that would be scannd a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven
o this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
but in our circumstance and course of thought tis heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasond for his passage
no
up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed at gaming swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation int then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damnd and black as hell whereto it goes
my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days
none words without thoughts never to heaven go
he will come straight
look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screend and stood between much heat and him
ill sconce me even here
pray you be round with him
none ill warrant you fear me not withdraw i hear him coming
now mother whats the matter
hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
mother you have my father much offended
come come you answer with an idle tongue
go go you question with a wicked tongue
why how now hamlet
whats the matter now
have you forgot me
no by the rood not so you are the queen your husbands brothers wife andwould it were not soyou are my mother
nay then ill set those to you that can speak
come come and sit you down you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you
what wilt thou do
thou wilt not murder me
help help ho
none none none o me what hast thou done
nay i know not is it the king
o what a rash and bloody deed is this
a bloody deed
almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother
as kill a king
ay lady twas my word
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou findst to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hands peace
sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damned custom have not brassd it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense
what have i done that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me
such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriagevows as false as dicers oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow yea this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage as against the doom is thoughtsick at the act
ay me what act that roars so loud and thunders in the index
look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperions curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury newlighted on a heavenkissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband
look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewd ear blasting his wholesome brother
have you eyes
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor
ha
have you eyes
you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame its humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this
sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexd for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was neer so thralld but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference
what devil wast that thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind
eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope
o shame
where is thy blush
rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matrons bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will
o hamlet speak no more thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct
nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed stewd in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in mine ears no more sweet hamlet
a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket
no more
a king of shreds and patches save me and hover oer me with your wings you heavenly guards
what would your gracious figure
alas hes mad
do you not come your tardy son to chide that lapsed in time and passion lets go by the important acting of your dread command
o say
do not forget this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
but look amazement on thy mother sits o step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her hamlet
how is it with you lady
alas how ist with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm your bedded hair like life in excrements starts up and stands on end
o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience
whereon do you look
on him on him
look you how pale he glares
his form and cause conjoind preaching to stones would make them capable
do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood
to whom do you speak this
do you see nothing there
nothing at all yet all that is i see
nor did you nothing hear
no nothing but ourselves
why look you there
look how it steals away
my father in his habit as he lived
look where he goes even now out at the portal
this the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in
ecstasy
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have utterd bring me to the test and i the matter will reword which madness would gambol from
mother for love of grace lay not that mattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whilst rank corruption mining all within infects unseen
confess yourself to heaven repent whats past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker
forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncles bed assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on
refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either  the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency
once more good night and when you are desirous to be blessd ill blessing beg of you
for this same lord i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister
i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him
so again good night
i must be cruel only to be kind thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one word more good lady
what shall i do
not this by no means that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers make you to ravel all this matter out that i essentially am not in madness but mad in craft
twere good you let him know for who thats but a queen fair sober wise would from a paddock from a bat a gib such dear concernings hide
who would do so
no in despite of sense and secrecy unpeg the basket on the houses top
let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down
be thou assured if words be made of breath and breath of life i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me
i must to england you know that
alack i had forgot tis so concluded on
theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fangd they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery
let it work for tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet
this man shall set me packing ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
mother good night
indeed this counsellor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave
come sir to draw toward an end with you
good night mother
theres matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate tis fit we understand them
where is your son
bestow this place on us a little while
ah my good lord what have i seen tonight
what gertrude
how does hamlet
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir whips out his rapier cries a rat a rat
and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man
o heavy deed
it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all to you yourself to us to every one
alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd
it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restraind and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life
where is he gone
to draw apart the body he hath killd oer whom his very madness like some ore among a mineral of metals base shows itself pure he weeps for what is done
o gertrude come away
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse
ho guildenstern
friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mothers closet hath he draggd him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel
i pray you haste in this
come gertrude well call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and whats untimely done whose whisper oer the worlds diameter as level as the cannon to his blank transports his poisond shot may miss our name and hit the woundless air
o come away
my soul is full of discord and dismay
safely stowed
none what noise
who calls on hamlet
o here they come
what have you done my lord with the dead body
compounded it with dust whereto tis kin
tell us where tis that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel
do not believe it
believe what
that i can keep your counsel and not mine own
besides to be demanded of a sponge
what replication should be made by the son of a king
take you me for a sponge my lord
ay sir that soaks up the kings countenance his rewards his authorities
but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
i understand you not my lord
i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear
my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king
the body is with the king but the king is not with the body
the king is a thing a thing my lord
of nothing bring me to him
hide fox and all after
i have sent to seek him and to find the body
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose
yet must not we put the strong law on him hes loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where tis so the offenders scourge is weighd but never the offence
to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all
how now
what hath befalln
where the dead body is bestowd my lord we cannot get from him
but where is he
without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
bring him before us
ho guildenstern
bring in my lord
now hamlet wheres polonius
at supper
at supper
where
not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are een at him
your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table thats the end
alas alas
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
what dost you mean by this
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar
where is polonius
in heaven send hither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i the other place yourself
but indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby
go seek him there
he will stay till ye come
hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast donemust send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help the associates tend and every thing is bent for england
for england
ay hamlet
good
so is it if thou knewst our purposes
i see a cherub that sees them
but come for england
farewell dear mother
thy loving father hamlet
my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother
come for england
follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not ill have him hence tonight away
for every thing is seald and done that else leans on the affair pray you make haste
and england if my love thou holdst at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to usthou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet
do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know tis done howeer my haps my joys were neer begun
go captain from me greet the danish king tell him that by his licence fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promised march over his kingdom
you know the rendezvous
if that his majesty would aught with us we shall express our duty in his eye and let him know so
i will dot my lord
go softly on
good sir whose powers are these
they are of norway sir
how purposed sir i pray you
against some part of poland
who commands them sir
the nephews to old norway fortinbras
goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier
truly to speak and with no addition we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name
to pay five ducats five i would not farm it nor will it yield to norway or the pole a ranker rate should it be sold in fee
why then the polack never will defend it
yes it is already garrisond
two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies
i humbly thank you sir
god be wi you sir
wilt please you go my lord
ill be with you straight go a little before
how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge
what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed
a beast no more
sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused
now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event a thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this things to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to dot
examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffd makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell
rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honours at the stake
how stand i then that have a father killd a mother staind excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep
while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain
o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
i will not speak with her
she is importunate indeed distract her mood will needs be pitied
what would she have
she speaks much of her father says she hears theres tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt that carry but half sense her speech is nothing yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection they aim at it and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them indeed would make one think there might be thought though nothing sure yet much unhappily
twere good she were spoken with for she may strew dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds
let her come in
to my sick soul as sins true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt
where is the beauteous majesty of denmark
how now ophelia
none how should i your true love know from another one
by his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon
alas sweet lady what imports this song
say you

he is dead and gone lady he is dead and gone at his head a grassgreen turf at his heels a stone

young men will dot if they come tot by cock they are to blame
quoth she before you tumbled me you promised me to wed so would i ha done by yonder sun an thou hadst not come to my bed

we must be patient but i cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him i the cold ground
my brother shall know of it and so i thank you for your good counsel

good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night
follow her close give her good watch i pray you
o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her fathers death
o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions
first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius death and we have done but greenly in huggermugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his fathers death wherein necessity of matter beggard will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear
o my dear gertrude this like to a murderingpiece in many places gives me superfluous death
alack what noise is this
where are my switzers
let them guard the door
what is the matter
save yourself my lord the ocean overpeering of his list eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young laertes in a riotous head oerbears your officers
the rabble call him lord and as the world were now but to begin antiquity forgot custom not known the ratifiers and props of every word they cry choose we laertes shall be king caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds laertes shall be king laertes king
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
o this is counter you false danish dogs
the doors are broke
where is this king
sirs stand you all without
no lets come in
i pray you give me leave
we will we will
i thank you keep the door
o thou vile king give me my father
calmly good laertes
that drop of blood thats calm proclaims me bastard cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot even here between the chaste unsmirched brow of my true mother
what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giantlike
let him go gertrude do not fear our person theres such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will
tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed
let him go gertrude
speak man
where is my father
dead
but not by him
let him demand his fill
how came he dead
ill not be juggled with to hell allegiance
vows to the blackest devil
conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
i dare damnation
to this point i stand that both the worlds i give to negligence let come what comes only ill be revenged most thoroughly for my father
who shall stay you
my will not all the world and for my means ill husband them so well they shall go far with little
good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear fathers death ist writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser
none but his enemies
will you know them then
to his good friends thus wide ill ope my arms and like the kind liferendering pelican repast them with my blood
why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman
that i am guiltless of your fathers death and am most sensible in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye
none how now
what noise is that
o heat dry up my brains
tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight till our scale turn the beam
o rose of may
dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia
o heavens
ist possible a young maids wits should be as moral as an old mans life
nature is fine in love and where tis fine it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves
none they bore him barefaced on the bier hey non nonny nonny hey nonny and in his grave raind many a tear fare you well my dove
hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge it could not move thus
none you must sing adown adown an you call him adowna
o how the wheel becomes it
it is the false steward that stole his masters daughter
this nothings more than matter
theres rosemary thats for remembrance pray love remember and there is pansies
thats for thoughts
a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
theres fennel for you and columbines theres rue for you and heres some for me we may call it herbgrace o sundays o you must wear your rue with a difference
theres a daisy i would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died they say he made a good end for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
thought and affliction passion hell itself she turns to favour and to prettiness
none and will he not come again
and will he not come again
no no he is dead go to thy deathbed he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow all flaxen was his poll he is gone he is gone and we cast away moan god ha mercy on his soul
and of all christian souls i pray god
god be wi ye
do you see this o god
laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right
go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touchd we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we can ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content
let this be so his means of death his obscure funeral no trophy sword nor hatchment oer his bones no noble rite nor formal ostentation cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth that i must callt in question
so you shall and where the offence is let the great axe fall
i pray you go with me
what are they that would speak with me
sailors sir they say they have letters for you
let them come in
i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet
god bless you sir
let him bless thee too
he shall sir ant please him
theres a letter for you sir it comes from the ambassador that was bound for england if your name be horatio as i am let to know it is
none this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him
ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase
finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple i boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so i alone became their prisoner
they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for them
let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death
i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter
these good fellows will bring thee where i am
rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england of them i have much to tell thee
farewell
he that thou knowest thine hamlet
come i will make you way for these your letters and dot the speedier that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them
now must your conscience my acquaintance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life
it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up
o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her
the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them
and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come
break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime
you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine how now
what news
letters my lord from hamlet this to your majesty this to the queen
from hamlet
who brought them
sailors my lord they say i saw them not they were given me by claudio he received them of him that brought them
laertes you shall hear them
leave us
high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom
tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return
hamlet
what should this mean
are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing
know you the hand
tis hamlets character
naked
and in a postscript here he says alone
can you advise me
im lost in it my lord
but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didest thou
if it be so laertes as how should it be so
how otherwise will you be ruled by me
ay my lord so you will not oerrule me to a peace
to thine own peace
if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident
my lord i will be ruled the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ
it falls right
you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege
what part is that my lord
a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness
two months since here was a gentleman of normandy ive seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsed and deminatured with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did
a norman wast
a norman
upon my life lamond
the very same
i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation
he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them
sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him
now out of this what out of this my lord
laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart
why ask you this
not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing
but to the quick o the ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words
to cut his throat i the church
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds
but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber
hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practise requite him for your father
i will dot and for that purpose ill anoint my sword
i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death
lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this should blast in proof
soft
let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat
when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there
how now sweet queen
one woe doth tread upon anothers heel so fast they follow your sisters drownd laertes
drownd
o where
there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook
her clothes spread wide and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death
alas then she is drownd
drownd drownd
too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will when these are gone the woman will be out
adieu my lord i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze but that this folly douts it
lets follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage
now fear i this will give it start again therefore lets follow
is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation
i tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial
how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence
why tis found so
it must be se offendendo it cannot be else
for here lies the point  if i drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do to perform argal she drowned herself wittingly
nay but hear you goodman delver give me leave
here lies the water good here stands the man good if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goesmark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
but is this law
ay marry ist crowners quest law
will you ha the truth ont
if this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o christian burial
why there thou sayst and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian
come my spade
there is no ancient gentleman but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers they hold up adams profession
was he a gentleman
he was the first that ever bore arms
why he had none
what art a heathen
how dost thou understand the scripture
the scripture says adam digged could he dig without arms
ill put another question to thee if thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself go to
what is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter
the gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants
i like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well but how does it well
it does well to those that do in now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal the gallows may do well to thee
tot again come
who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenter
ay tell me that and unyoke
marry now i can tell
tot
mass i cannot tell
cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question next say a gravemaker the houses that he makes last till doomsday
go get thee to yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor
in youth when i did love did love methought it was very sweet to contract o the time for ah my behove o methought there was nothing meet
has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at gravemaking
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
tis een so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense
none but age with his stealing steps hath clawd me in his clutch and hath shipped me intil the land as if i had never been such
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were cains jawbone that did the first murder
it might be the pate of a politician which this ass now oerreaches one that would circumvent god might it not
it might my lord
or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord
how dost thou good lord
this might be my lord suchaone that praised my lord suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might it not
ay my lord
why een so and now my lady worms chapless and knocked about the mazzard with a sextons spade heres fine revolution an we had the trick to seet
did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with em
mine ache to think ont
a pickaxe and a spade a spade for and a shrouding sheet o a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet
theres another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
where be his quiddities now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery
hum
this fellow might be ins time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt
will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures
the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
not a jot more my lord
is not parchment made of sheepskins
ay my lord and of calfskins too
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that
i will speak to this fellow
whose graves this sirrah
mine sir
o a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet
i think it be thine indeed for thou liest int
you lie out ont sir and therefore it is not yours for my part i do not lie int and yet it is mine
thou dost lie int to be int and say it is thine tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
tis a quick lie sir twill away gain from me to you
what man dost thou dig it for
for no man sir
what woman then
for none neither
who is to be buried int
one that was a woman sir but rest her soul shes dead
how absolute the knave is
we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us
by the lord horatio these three years i have taken a note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he gaffs his kibe
how long hast thou been a gravemaker
of all the days i the year i came tot that day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras
how long is that since
cannot you tell that
every fool can tell that it was the very day that young hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into england
ay marry why was he sent into england
why because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not its no great matter there
why
twill a not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as he
how came he mad
very strangely they say
how strangely
faith een with losing his wits
upon what ground
why here in denmark i have been sexton here man and boy thirty years
how long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot
i faith if he be not rotten before he dieas we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying inhe will last you some eight year or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
why he more than another
why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
heres a skull now this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years
whose was it
a whoreson mad fellows it was whose do you think it was
nay i know not
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue
a poured a flagon of rhenish on my head once
this same skull sir was yoricks skull the kings jester
this
een that
let me see
alas poor yorick
i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is
my gorge rims at it
here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft
where be your gibes now
your gambols
your songs
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar
not one now to mock your own grinning
quite chapfallen
now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come make her laugh at that
prithee horatio tell me one thing
whats that my lord
dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i the earth
een so
and smelt so
pah
een so my lord
to what base uses we may return horatio
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole
twere to consider too curiously to consider so
no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel
imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
but soft
but soft
aside here comes the king
the queen the courtiers who is this they follow
and with such maimed rites
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life twas of some estate
couch we awhile and mark
what ceremony else
that is laertes a very noble youth mark
what ceremony else
her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warrantise her death was doubtful and but that great command oersways the order she should in ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet for charitable prayers shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her yet here she is allowd her virgin crants her maiden strewments and the bringing home of bell and burial
must there no more be done
no more be done we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peaceparted souls
lay her i the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring
i tell thee churlish priest a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling
what the fair ophelia
sweets to the sweet farewell
i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlets wife i thought thy bridebed to have deckd sweet maid and not have strewd thy grave
o treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of
hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to oertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus
none bears such an emphasis
whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonderwounded hearers
this is i hamlet the dane
the devil take thy soul
thou prayst not well
i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i something in me dangerous which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand
pluck them asunder
hamlet hamlet
gentlemen good my lord be quiet
why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag
o my son what theme
i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum
what wilt thou do for her
o he is mad laertes
for love of god forbear him
swounds show me what thoult do woot weep
woot fight
woot fast
woot tear thyself
woot drink up eisel
eat a crocodile
ill dot
dost thou come here to whine
to outface me with leaping in her grave
be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart
nay an thoult mouth ill rant as well as thou
this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed his silence will sit drooping
hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus
i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day
i pray you good horatio wait upon him
strengthen your patience in our last nights speech well put the matter to the present push
good gertrude set some watch over your son
this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be
so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance
remember it my lord
sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes
rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us theres a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will that is most certain
up from my cabin my seagown scarfd about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire
fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio o royal knaveryan exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmarks health and englands too with ho
such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off
ist possible
heres the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed
i beseech you
being thus benetted round with villanies ere i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the playi sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labourd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeomans service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote
ay good my lord
an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many suchlike ases of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shrivingtime allowd
how was this seald
why even in that was heaven ordinant
i had my fathers signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely the changeling never known
now the next day was our seafight and what to this was sequent thou knowst already
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot
why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites
why what a king is this
does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon he that hath killd my king and whored my mother poppd in between the election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm
and ist not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there
it will be short the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one
but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his ill court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion
peace
who comes here
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
i humbly thank you sir
dost know this waterfly
no my good lord
thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him
he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt
sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty
i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit
put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head
i thank your lordship it is very hot
no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly
it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas twerei cannot tell how
but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter i beseech you remember nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see
sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
the concernancy sir
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath
sir
ist not possible to understand in another tongue
you will dot sir really
what imports the nomination of this gentleman
of laertes
his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent
of him sir
i know you are not ignorant i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me
well sir
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed
whats his weapon
rapier and dagger
thats two of his weapons but well
the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit
what call you the carriages
i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
the carriages sir are the hangers
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then
but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberalconceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish
why is this imponed as you call it
the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
how if i answer no
i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
shall i redeliver you een so
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
i commend my duty to your lordship
yours yours
he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors turn
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
he did comply with his dug before he sucked it
thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time
i am constant to my purpose they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now
the king and queen and all are coming down
in happy time
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play
she well instructs me
you will lose this wager my lord
i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds
but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter
nay good my lord it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman
if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit
not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow
if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes
come hamlet come and take this hand from me
give me your pardon sir ive done you wrong but pardont as you are a gentleman
this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punishd with sore distraction
what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
wast hamlet wrongd laertes
never hamlet if hamlet from himself be taen away and when hes not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
who does it then
his madness ift be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd his madness is poor hamlets enemy
sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot mine arrow oer the house and hurt my brother
i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored
but till that time i do receive your offerd love like love and will not wrong it
i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play
give us the foils
come on
come one for me
ill be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i the darkest night stick fiery off indeed
you mock me sir
no by this hand
give them the foils young osric
cousin hamlet you know the wager
very well my lord your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is betterd we have therefore odds
this is too heavy let me see another
this likes me well
these foils have all a length
ay my good lord
set me the stoops of wine upon that table
if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlets better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmarks crown have worn
give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth now the king dunks to hamlet
come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye
come on sir
come my lord
one
no
judgment
a hit a very palpable hit
well again
stay give me drink
hamlet this pearl is thine heres to thy health
give him the cup
ill play this bout first set it by awhile
come
another hit what say you
a touch a touch i do confess
our son shall win
hes fat and scant of breath
here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet
good madam
gertrude do not drink
i will my lord i pray you pardon me
none i dare not drink yet madam by and by
come let me wipe thy face
my lord ill hit him now
i do not thinkt
none come for the third laertes you but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me
say you so
come on
nothing neither way
have at you now
part them they are incensed
nay come again
look to the queen there ho
they bleed on both sides
how is it my lord
how ist laertes
why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric i am justly killd with mine own treachery
how does the queen
she swounds to see them bleed
no no the drink the drinko my dear hamlet the drink the drink
i am poisond
o villany
ho
let the door be lockd treachery
seek it out
it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain no medicine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour of life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomd the foul practise hath turnd itself on me lo here i lie never to rise again thy mothers poisond i can no more the king the kings to blame
the pointenvenomd too
then venom to thy work
treason
treason
o yet defend me friends i am but hurt
here thou incestuous murderous damned dane drink off this potion
is thy union here
follow my mother
he is justly served it is a poison temperd by himself
exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my fathers death come not upon thee nor thine on me
heaven make thee free of it
i follow thee
i am dead horatio
wretched queen adieu
you that look pale and tremble at this chance that are but mutes or audience to this act had i but timeas this fell sergeant death is strict in his arresto i could tell you but let it be
horatio i am dead thou livest report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied
never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane heres yet some liquor left
as thourt a man give me the cup let go by heaven ill havet
o good horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story
what warlike noise is this
young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley
o i die horatio the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with the occurrents more and less which have solicited
the rest is silence
now cracks a noble heart
good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
why does the drum come hither
where is this sight
what is it ye would see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
this quarry cries on havoc
o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck
the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfilld that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks
not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors reads all this can i truly deliver
let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience
for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen
let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally and for his passage the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him
take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss
go bid the soldiers shoot
hence
home you idle creatures get you home is this a holiday
what
know you not being mechanical you ought not walk upon a labouring day without the sign of your profession
speak what trade art thou
why sir a carpenter
where is thy leather apron and thy rule
what dost thou with thy best apparel on
you sir what trade are you
truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler
but what trade art thou
answer me directly
a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
what trade thou knave
thou naughty knave what trade
nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you
what meanest thou by that
mend me thou saucy fellow
why sir cobble you
thou art a cobbler art thou
truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl
i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them
as proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
but wherefore art not in thy shop today
why dost thou lead these men about the streets
truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work
but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
wherefore rejoice
what conquest brings he home
what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels
you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome knew you not pompey
many a time and oft have you climbd up to walls and battlements to towers and windows yea to chimneytops your infants in your arms and there have sat the livelong day with patient expectation to see great pompey pass the streets of rome and when you saw his chariot but appear have you not made an universal shout that tiber trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompeys blood
be gone
run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude
go go good countrymen and for this fault assemble all the poor men of your sort draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all
see whether their basest metal be not moved they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the capitol this way will i disrobe the images if you do find them deckd with ceremonies
may we do so
you know it is the feast of lupercal
it is no matter let no images be hung with caesars trophies
ill about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick
these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness
calpurnia
peace ho
caesar speaks
calpurnia
here my lord
stand you directly in antonius way when he doth run his course
antonius
caesar my lord
forget not in your speed antonius to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse
i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performd
set on and leave no ceremony out
caesar
ha
who calls
bid every noise be still peace yet again
who is it in the press that calls on me
i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar
speak caesar is turnd to hear
beware the ides of march
what man is that
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march
set him before me let me see his face
fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
what sayst thou to me now
speak once again
beware the ides of march
he is a dreamer let us leave him pass
will you go see the order of the course
not i i pray you do
i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony
let me not hinder cassius your desires ill leave you
brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you
cassius be not deceived if i have veild my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself
vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men
then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good brutus can you see your face
no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things
tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow
i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this ages yoke have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes
into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me
therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous
what means this shouting
i do fear the people choose caesar for their king
ay do you fear it
then must i think you would not have it so
i would not cassius yet i love him well
but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death
i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour
well honour is the subject of my story
i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself
i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point
upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did
the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink
i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar
and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl
ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone
another general shout
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heapd on caesar
why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great
age thou art shamed
rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talkd of rome that her wide walls encompassd but one man
now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man
o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brookd the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king
that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved
what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things
till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus
the games are done and caesar is returning
as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today
i will do so
but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossd in conference by some senators
casca will tell us what the matter is
antonius
caesar
let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous
fear him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given
would he were fatter
but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius
he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing
such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous
i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear for always i am caesar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him
you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad
why you were with him were you not
i should not then ask casca what had chanced
why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting
what was the second noise for
why for that too
they shouted thrice what was the last cry for
why for that too
was the crown offered him thrice
ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted
who offered him the crown
why antony
tell us the manner of it gentle casca
i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it
i saw mark antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it
then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it
and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air
but soft i pray you what did caesar swound
he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless
tis very like he hath the failing sickness
no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness
i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down
if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man
what said he when he came unto himself
marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut
an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues
and so he fell
when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul
and forgave him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
and after that he came thus sad away
ay
did cicero say any thing
ay he spoke greek
to what effect
nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me
i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesars images are put to silence
fare you well
there was more foolery yet if i could remember it
will you sup with me tonight casca
no i am promised forth
will you dine with me tomorrow
ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
good i will expect you
do so
farewell both
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
he was quick mettle when he went to school
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite
and so it is
for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you
i will do so till then think of the world
well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced
caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me
i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure
good even casca brought you caesar home
why are you breathless
and why stare you so
are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm
o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire
either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction
why saw you any thing more wonderful
a common slaveyou know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
besidesi ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon
indeed it is a strangedisposed time but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves
come caesar to the capitol tomorrow
he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow
good night then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in
farewell cicero
whos there
a roman
casca by your voice
your ear is good
cassius what night is this
a very pleasing night to honest men
who ever knew the heavens menace so
those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part i have walkd about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunderstone and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us
you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not
you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fool and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state
now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are
tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while
our fathers minds are dead and we are governd with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy
i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself
if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure
so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity
and why should caesar be a tyrant then
poor man
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar
but o grief where hast thou led me
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made
but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent
you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale
hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest
theres a bargain made
now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblestminded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourabledangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompeys porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favours like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible
stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend
cinna where haste you so
to find out you
whos that
metellus cimber
no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts
am i not stayd for cinna
i am glad on t
what a fearful night is this
theres two or three of us have seen strange sights
am i not stayd for
tell me
yes you are
o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetors chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue all this done repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us
is decius brutus and trebonius there
all but metellus cimber and hes gone to seek you at your house
well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me
that done repair to pompeys theatre
come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours
o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited
let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him
what lucius ho
i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day
lucius i say
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
when lucius when
awake i say
what lucius
calld you my lord
get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here
i will my lord
it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general
he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking
crown himthat and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason
but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round
he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend
so caesar may
then lest he may prevent
and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell
the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seald up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed
get you to bed again it is not day
is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
i know not sir
look in the calendar and bring me word
i will sir
the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them
brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
shall rome c speak strike redress
brutus thou sleepst awake
such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up
shall rome c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one mans awe
what rome
my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was calld a king
speak strike redress
am i entreated to speak and strike
o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus
sir march is wasted fourteen days
tis good
go to the gate somebody knocks
since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection
sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you
is he alone
no sir there are moe with him
do you know them
no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour
let em enter
they are the faction
o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free
o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage
seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention
i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you
i have been up this hour awake all night
know i these men that come along with you
yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you
this is trebonius
he is welcome hither
this decius brutus
he is welcome too
this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night
shall i entreat a word
here lies the east doth not the day break here
no
o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day
you shall confess that you are both deceived
here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here
give me your hands all over one by one
and let us swear our resolution
no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the times abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let highsighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery
but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passd from him
but what of cicero
shall we sound him
i think he will stand very strong with us
let us not leave him out
no by no means
o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy mens voices to commend our deeds it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity
o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin
then leave him out
indeed he is not fit
shall no man else be touchd but only caesar
decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together
our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar
but alas caesar must bleed for it
and gentle friends lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be calld purgers not murderers
and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesars arm when caesars head is off
yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company
there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
peace
count the clock
the clock hath stricken three
tis time to part
but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomd terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today
never fear that if he be so resolved i can oersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayd with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered
let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol
nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
by the eighth hour is that the uttermost
be that the uttermost and fail not then
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him
now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and ill fashion him
the morning comes upon s well leave you brutus
and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans
good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one
boy
lucius
fast asleep
it is no matter enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleepst so sound
brutus my lord
portia what mean you
wherefore rise you now
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning
nor for yours neither
youve ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walkd about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i askd you what the matter was you stared upon me with ungentle looks i urged you further then you scratchd your head and too impatiently stampd with your foot yet i insisted yet you answerd not but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seemd too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour which sometime hath his hour with every man
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevaild on your condition i should not know you brutus
dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief
i am not well in health and that is all
brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it
why so i do
good portia go to bed
is brutus sick
and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning
what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness
no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my oncecommended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one that you unfold to me yourself your half why you are heavy and what men tonight have had to resort to you for here have been some six or seven who did hide their faces even from darkness
kneel not gentle portia
i should not need if you were gentle brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me brutus is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you
am i yourself but as it were in sort or limitation to keep with you at meals comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes
dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure
if it be no more portia is brutus harlot not his wife
you are my true and honourable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart if this were true then should i know this secret
i grant i am a woman but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife i grant i am a woman but withal a woman wellreputed catos daughter
think you i am no stronger than my sex being so fatherd and so husbanded
tell me your counsels i will not disclose em i have made strong proof of my constancy giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
and not my husbands secrets
o ye gods render me worthy of this noble wife
hark hark
one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart
all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste
lucius whos that knocks
he is a sick man that would speak with you
caius ligarius that metellus spake of
boy stand aside
caius ligarius
how
vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief
would you were not sick
i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour
such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it
by all the gods that romans bow before i here discard my sickness
soul of rome
brave son derived from honourable loins
thou like an exorcist hast conjured up my mortified spirit
now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them
whats to do
a piece of work that will make sick men whole
but are not some whole that we must make sick
that must we also
what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done
set on your foot and with a heart newfired i follow you to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on
follow me then
nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out help ho
they murder caesar
whos within
my lord
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success
i will my lord
what mean you caesar
think you to walk forth
you shall not stir out of your house today
caesar shall forth the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished
caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me
there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
o caesar
these things are beyond all use and i do fear them
what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar
when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that i yet have heard
it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come
what say the augurers
they would not have you to stir forth today
plucking the entrails of an offering forth they could not find a heart within the beast
the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear
no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litterd in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth
alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence
do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own
well send mark antony to the senatehouse and he shall say you are not well today let me upon my knee prevail in this
mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home
heres decius brutus he shall tell them so
caesar all hail
good morrow worthy caesar i come to fetch you to the senatehouse
and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today tell them so decius
say he is sick
shall caesar send a lie
have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
decius go tell them caesar will not come
most mighty caesar let me know some cause lest i be laughd at when i tell them so
the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate
but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statua which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today
this dream is all amiss interpreted it was a vision fair and fortunate your statue spouting blood in many pipes in which so many smiling romans bathed signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood and that great men shall press for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by calpurnias dream is signified
and this way have you well expounded it
i have when you have heard what i can say and know it now the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
if you shall send them word you will not come their minds may change
besides it were a mock apt to be renderd for some one to say break up the senate till another time when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper lo caesar is afraid
pardon me caesar for my dear dear love to our proceeding bids me tell you this and reason to my love is liable
how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
i am ashamed i did yield to them
give me my robe for i will go
and look where publius is come to fetch me
good morrow caesar
welcome publius
what brutus are you stirrd so early too
good morrow casca
caius ligarius caesar was neer so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean
what is t oclock
caesar tis strucken eight
i thank you for your pains and courtesy
see
antony that revels long o nights is notwithstanding up
good morrow antony
so to most noble caesar
bid them prepare within i am to blame to be thus waited for
now cinna now metellus what trebonius
i have an hours talk in store for you remember that you call on me today be near me that i may remember you
caesar i will and so near will i be that your best friends shall wish i had been further
good friends go in and taste some wine with me and we like friends will straightway go together
none the heart of brutus yearns to think upon
caesar beware of brutus take heed of cassius come not near casca have an eye to cinna trust not trebonius mark well metellus cimber decius brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged caius ligarius
there is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against caesar
if thou beest not immortal look about you security gives way to conspiracy
the mighty gods defend thee
thy lover artemidorus
here will i stand till caesar pass along and as a suitor will i give him this
my heart laments that virtue cannot live out of the teeth of emulation
if thou read this o caesar thou mayst live if not the fates with traitors do contrive
i prithee boy run to the senatehouse stay not to answer me but get thee gone why dost thou stay
to know my errand madam
i would have had thee there and here again ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
o constancy be strong upon my side set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue
i have a mans mind but a womans might
how hard it is for women to keep counsel
art thou here yet
madam what should i do
run to the capitol and nothing else
and so return to you and nothing else
yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well for he went sickly forth and take good note what caesar doth what suitors press to him
hark boy
what noise is that
i hear none madam
prithee listen well i heard a bustling rumour like a fray and the wind brings it from the capitol
sooth madam i hear nothing
come hither fellow which way hast thou been
at mine own house good lady
what ist oclock
about the ninth hour lady
is caesar yet gone to the capitol
madam not yet i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol
thou hast some suit to caesar hast thou not
that i have lady if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me i shall beseech him to befriend himself
why knowst thou any harms intended towards him
none that i know will be much that i fear may chance
good morrow to you
here the street is narrow the throng that follows caesar at the heels of senators of praetors common suitors will crowd a feeble man almost to death ill get me to a place more void and there speak to great caesar as he comes along
i must go in
ay me how weak a thing the heart of woman is
o brutus the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
sure the boy heard me brutus hath a suit that caesar will not grant
o i grow faint
run lucius and commend me to my lord say i am merry come to me again and bring me word what he doth say to thee
none ay caesar but not gone
hail caesar
read this schedule
trebonius doth desire you to oerread at your best leisure this his humble suit
o caesar read mine first for mines a suit that touches caesar nearer read it great caesar
what touches us ourself shall be last served
delay not caesar read it instantly
what is the fellow mad
sirrah give place
what urge you your petitions in the street
come to the capitol
i wish your enterprise today may thrive
what enterprise popilius
fare you well
what said popilius lena
he wishd today our enterprise might thrive
i fear our purpose is discovered
look how he makes to caesar mark him
casca be sudden for we fear prevention
brutus what shall be done
if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself
cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
he draws mark antony out of the way
where is metellus cimber
let him go and presently prefer his suit to caesar
he is addressd press near and second him
casca you are the first that rears your hand
are we all ready
what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress
most high most mighty and most puissant caesar metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart i must prevent thee cimber
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children
be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning
thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied
is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear for the repealing of my banishd brother
i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal
what brutus
pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose truefixd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but theres but one in all doth hold his place so in the world tis furnishd well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banishd and constant do remain to keep him so
o caesar hence
wilt thou lift up olympus
great caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel
speak hands for me
et tu brute
then fall caesar
liberty
freedom
tyranny is dead
run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement
people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand stiff ambitions debt is paid
go to the pulpit brutus
and cassius too
wheres publius
here quite confounded with this mutiny
stand fast together lest some friend of caesars should chance talk not of standing
publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius
and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief
do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers
where is antony
fled to his house amazed men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday
fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon
why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death
grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesars friends that have abridged his time of fearing death
stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons oer our heads lets all cry peace freedom and liberty
stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown
how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompeys basis lies along no worthier than the dust
so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be calld the men that gave their country liberty
what shall we forth
ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
soft
who comes here
a friend of antonys
thus brutus did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving say i love brutus and i honour him say i feard caesar honourd him and loved him
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith
so says my master antony
thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse
tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honour depart untouchd
ill fetch him presently
i know that we shall have him well to friend
i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose
but here comes antony
welcome mark antony
o mighty caesar
dost thou lie so low
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure
fare thee well
i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesars death hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world
i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfil your pleasure
live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age
o antony beg not your death of us
though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar
for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
your voice shall be as strong as any mans in the disposing of new dignities
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded
i doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not last in love yours good trebonius
gentlemen allalas what shall i say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer
that i did love thee caesar o tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy thy anthony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble
in the presence of thy corse
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies
pardon me julius
here wast thou bayd brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe
o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie
mark antony pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty
i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us
will you be prickd in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you
therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayd from the point by looking down on caesar
friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous
or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied
thats all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral
you shall mark antony
brutus a word with you
you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter
by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesars death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
it shall advantage more than do us wrong
i know not what may fall i like it not
mark antony here take you caesars body
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you dot by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended
be it so
i do desire no more
prepare the body then and follow us
o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarterd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesars spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial
you serve octavius caesar do you not
i do mark antony
caesar did write for him to come to rome
he did receive his letters and is coming and bid me say to you by word of mouth o caesar thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water
is thy master coming
he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so
yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things
lend me your hand
we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
then follow me and give me audience friends
cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers
those that will hear me speak let em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be rendered of caesars death
i will hear brutus speak
i will hear cassius and compare their reasons when severally we hear them rendered
the noble brutus is ascended silence
be patient till the last
romans countrymen and lovers
hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesars to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his
if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more
had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men
as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him
there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition
who is here so base that would be a bondman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so rude that would not be a roman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so vile that will not love his country
if any speak for him have i offended
i pause for a reply
none brutus none
then none have i offended
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death
here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not
with this i departthat as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death
live brutus
live live
bring him with triumph home unto his house
give him a statue with his ancestors
let him be caesar
caesars better parts shall be crownd in brutus
well bring him to his house with shouts and clamours
my countrymen peace silence
brutus speaks
peace ho
good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesars corpse and grace his speech tending to caesars glories which mark antony by our permission is allowd to make
i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke
stay ho
and let us hear mark antony
let him go up into the public chair well hear him
noble antony go up
for brutus sake i am beholding to you
what does he say of brutus
he says for brutus sake he finds himself beholding to us all
twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
this caesar was a tyrant
nay thats certain we are blest that rome is rid of him
peace
let us hear what antony can say
you gentle romans peace ho
let us hear him
friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar
the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answerd it
here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesars funeral
he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man
he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know
you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
o judgment
thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason
bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me
methinks there is much reason in his sayings
if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong
has he masters
i fear there will a worse come in his place
markd ye his words
he would not take the crown therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
if it be found so some will dear abide it
poor soul
his eyes are red as fire with weeping
theres not a nobler man in rome than antony
now mark him he begins again to speak
but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there
and none so poor to do him reverence
o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men
but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue
well hear the will read it mark antony
the will the will
we will hear caesars will
have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men bearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it
read the will well hear it antony you shall read us the will caesars will
will you be patient
will you stay awhile
i have oershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it
they were traitors honourable men
the will
the testament
they were villains murderers the will
read the will
you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will
shall i descend
and will you give me leave
come down
descend
you shall have leave
a ring stand round
stand from the hearse stand from the body
room for antony most noble antony
nay press not so upon me stand far off
stand back room bear back
if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summers evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar followd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
o what a fall was there my countrymen
then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops
kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded
look you here here is himself marrd as you see with traitors
o piteous spectacle
o noble caesar
o woful day
o traitors villains
o most bloody sight
we will be revenged
revenge
about
seek
burn
fire
kill
slay
let not a traitor live
stay countrymen
peace there
hear the noble antony
well hear him well follow him well die with him
good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny
they that have done this deed are honourable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you
i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir mens blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny
well mutiny
well burn the house of brutus
away then
come seek the conspirators
yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
peace ho
hear antony
most noble antony
why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves
alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of
most true
the will
lets stay and hear the will
here is the will and under caesars seal
to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventyfive drachmas
most noble caesar
well revenge his death
o royal caesar
hear me with patience
peace ho
moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbours and newplanted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs for ever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves
here was a caesar
when comes such another
never never
come away away
well burn his body in the holy place and with the brands fire the traitors houses
take up the body
go fetch fire
pluck down benches
pluck down forms windows any thing
now let it work
mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt
how now fellow
sir octavius is already come to rome
where is he
he and lepidus are at caesars house
and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish
fortune is merry and in this mood will give us any thing
i heard him say brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome
belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them
bring me to octavius
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with caesar and things unlucky charge my fantasy i have no will to wander forth of doors yet something leads me forth
what is your name
whither are you going
where do you dwell
are you a married man or a bachelor
answer every man directly
ay and briefly
ay and wisely
ay and truly you were best
what is my name
whither am i going
where do i dwell
am i a married man or a bachelor
then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly wisely i say i am a bachelor
thats as much as to say they are fools that marry youll bear me a bang for that i fear
proceed directly
directly i am going to caesars funeral
as a friend or an enemy
as a friend
that matter is answered directly
for your dwellingbriefly
briefly i dwell by the capitol
your name sir truly
truly my name is cinna
tear him to pieces hes a conspirator
i am cinna the poet i am cinna the poet
tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses
i am not cinna the conspirator
it is no matter his names cinna pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going
tear him tear him
come brands ho
firebrands to brutus to cassius burn all some to decius house and some to cascas some to ligarius away go
these many then shall die their names are prickd
your brother too must die consent you lepidus
i do consent prick him down antony
upon condition publius shall not live who is your sisters son mark antony
he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
but lepidus go you to caesars house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies
what shall i find you here
or here or at the capitol
this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it
so you thought him and took his voice who should be prickd to die in our black sentence and proscription
octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons
you may do your will but hes a tried and valiant soldier
so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governd by my spirit
and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and traind and bid go forth a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds on abjects orts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property
and now octavius listen great thingsbrutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretchd and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answered
let us do so for we are at the stake and bayd about with many enemies and some that smile have in their hearts i fear millions of mischiefs
stand ho
give the word ho
and stand
what now lucilius
is cassius near
he is at hand and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master
he greets me well
your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is full of regard and honour
he is not doubted
a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved
with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old
thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial
comes his army on
they mean this night in sardis to be quarterd the greater part the horse in general are come with cassius
hark
he is arrived
march gently on to meet him
stand ho
stand ho
speak the word along
stand
stand
stand
most noble brother you have done me wrong
judge me you gods
wrong i mine enemies
and if not so how should i wrong a brother
brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them cassius be content
speak your griefs softly i do know you well
before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience
pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground
lucilius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference
let lucius and titinius guard our door
that you have wrongd me doth appear in this you have condemnd and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off
you wronged yourself to write in such a case
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment
let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemnd to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers
i an itching palm
you know that you are brutus that speak this or by the gods this speech were else your last
the name of cassius honours this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
chastisement
remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice sake
what villain touchd his body that did stab and not for justice
what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman
brutus bay not me ill not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practise abler than yourself to make conditions
go to you are not cassius
i am
i say you are not
urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no further
away slight man
ist possible
hear me for i will speak
must i give way and room to your rash choler
shall i be frighted when a madman stares
o ye gods ye gods
must i endure all this
all this
ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble
must i budge
must i observe you
must i stand and crouch under your testy humour
by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish
is it come to this
you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men
you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better
if you did i care not
when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
peace peace
you durst not so have tempted him
i durst not
no
what durst not tempt him
for your life you durst not
do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for
you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not
i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius
should i have answerd caius cassius so
when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces
i denied you not
you did
i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back
brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friends infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are
i do not till you practise them on me
you love me not
i do not like your faults
a friendly eye could never see such faults
a flatterers would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus
come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother chequed like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote to cast into my teeth
o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes
there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou best a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius
sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonour shall be humour
o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again
hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
when i spoke that i was illtemperd too
do you confess so much
give me your hand
and my heart too
o brutus
whats the matter
have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful
yes cassius and from henceforth when you are overearnest with your brutus hell think your mother chides and leave you so
none there is some grudge between em tis not meet they be alone
none none how now
whats the matter
for shame you generals
what do you mean
love and be friends as two such men should be for i have seen more years im sure than ye
ha ha
how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
bear with him brutus tis his fashion
ill know his humour when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools
companion hence
away away be gone
lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight
and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us
lucius a bowl of wine
i did not think you could have been so angry
o cassius i am sick of many griefs
of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils
no man bears sorrow better
portia is dead
ha
portia
she is dead
how scaped i killing when i crossd you so
o insupportable and touching loss
upon what sickness
impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strongfor with her death that tidings camewith this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowd fire
and died so
even so
o ye immortal gods
speak no more of her
give me a bowl of wine
in this i bury all unkindness cassius
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus love
come in titinius
welcome good messala
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities
portia art thou gone
no more i pray you
messala i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
with what addition
that by proscription and bills of outlawry octavius antony and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators
therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one
cicero one
cicero is dead and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord
no messala
nor nothing in your letters writ of her
nothing messala
that methinks is strange
why ask you
hear you aught of her in yours
no my lord
now as you are a roman tell me true
then like a roman bear the truth i tell for certain she is dead and by strange manner
why farewell portia
we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now
even so great men great losses should endure
i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so
well to our work alive
what do you think of marching to philippi presently
i do not think it good
your reason
this it is tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offence whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness
good reasons must of force give place to better
the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshd newadded and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back
hear me good brother
under your pardon
you must note beside that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries
on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures
then with your will go on well along ourselves and meet them at philippi
the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest
there is no more to say
no more
good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence
lucius
my gown
farewell good messala good night titinius
noble noble cassius good night and good repose
o my dear brother
this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division tween our souls
let it not brutus
every thing is well

so please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me

ay my lord ant please you

i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest
i have slept my lord already

this is a sleepy tune
o murderous slumber layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music
gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod thou breakst thy instrument ill take it from thee and good boy good night
let me see let me see is not the leaf turnd down where i left reading
here it is i think
how ill this taper burns
ha
who comes here
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition
it comes upon me
art thou any thing
art thou some god some angel or some devil that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
speak to me what thou art
thy evil spirit brutus
why comest thou
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi
well then i shall see thee again
ay at philippi
why i will see thee at philippi then
now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee
boy lucius
varro
claudius
sirs awake
claudius
the strings my lord are false
he thinks he still is at his instrument
lucius awake
my lord
didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out
my lord i do not know that i did cry
yes that thou didst didst thou see any thing
nothing my lord
sleep again lucius
sirrah claudius
fellow thou awake
my lord
my lord
why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
did we my lord
ay saw you any thing
no my lord i saw nothing
nor i my lord
go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow
it shall be done my lord
now antony our hopes are answered you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions it proves not so their battles are at hand they mean to warn us at philippi here answering before we do demand of them
tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so
prepare you generals the enemy comes on in gallant show their bloody sign of battle is hung out and something to be done immediately
octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field
upon the right hand i keep thou the left
why do you cross me in this exigent
i do not cross you but i will do so
they stand and would have parley
stand fast titinius we must out and talk
mark antony shall we give sign of battle
no caesar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words
stir not until the signal
words before blows is it so countrymen
not that we love words better as you do
good words are better than bad strokes octavius
in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesars heart crying long live
hail caesar
antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless
not stingless too
o yes and soundless too for you have stoln their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting
villains you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck
o you flatterers
flatterers
now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled
come come the cause if arguing make us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops
look i draw a sword against conspirators when think you that the sword goes up again
never till caesars three and thirty wounds be well avenged or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bringst them with thee
so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword
o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable
a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour joind with a masker and a reveller
old cassius still
come antony away
defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth if you dare fight today come to the field if not when you have stomachs
why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
the storm is up and all is on the hazard
ho lucilius
hark a word with you
none messala
none messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born
give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelld to set upon one battle all our liberties
you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage
coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly oer our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost
believe not so
i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly
even so lucilius
now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain lets reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do
even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below
then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome
no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind
but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius
if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made
for ever and for ever farewell brutus
if we do meet again well smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made
why then lead on
o that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come
but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known
come ho
away
ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side
let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow
ride ride messala let them all come down
o look titinius look the villains fly
myself have to mine own turnd enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him
o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclosed
fly further off my lord fly further off mark antony is in your tents my lord fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
this hill is far enough
look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire
they are my lord
titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy
i will be here again even with a thought
go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou notest about the field
this day i breathed first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass
sirrah what news
none what news
none with horsemen that make to him on the spur yet he spurs on
now they are almost on him
now titinius
now some light
o he lights too
hes taen
and hark
they shout for joy
come down behold no more
o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend taen before my face
come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it
come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesars bowels search this bosom
stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is coverd as tis now guide thou the sword
caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that killd thee
so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will
o cassius far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him
it is but change titinius for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus power as cassius legions are by antony
these tidings will well comfort cassius
where did you leave him
all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill
is not that he that lies upon the ground
he lies not like the living
o my heart
is not that he
no this was he messala but cassius is no more
o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight so in his red blood cassius day is set the sun of rome is set
our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
mistrust of my success hath done this deed
mistrust of good success hath done this deed
o hateful error melancholys child why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not
o error soon conceived thou never comest unto a happy birth but killst the mother that engenderd thee
what pindarus
where art thou pindarus
seek him titinius whilst i go to meet the noble brutus thrusting this report into his ears i may say thrusting it for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight
hie you messala and i will seek for pindarus the while
why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
did i not meet thy friends
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee
didst thou not hear their shouts
alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
but hold thee take this garland on thy brow thy brutus bid me give it thee and i will do his bidding
brutus come apace and see how i regarded caius cassius
by your leave godsthis is a romans part come cassius sword and find titinius heart
where where messala doth his body lie
lo yonder and titinius mourning it
titinius face is upward
he is slain
o julius caesar thou art mighty yet
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails
brave titinius
look whether he have not crownd dead cassius
are yet two romans living such as these
the last of all the romans fare thee well
it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow
friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay
i shall find time cassius i shall find time
come therefore and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us
lucilius come and come young cato let us to the field
labeo and flavius set our battles on tis three oclock and romans yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight
yet countrymen o yet hold up your heads
what bastard doth not
who will go with me
i will proclaim my name about the field i am the son of marcus cato ho
a foe to tyrants and my countrys friend i am the son of marcus cato ho
and i am brutus marcus brutus i brutus my countrys friend know me for brutus
o young and noble cato art thou down
why now thou diest as bravely as titinius and mayst be honourd being catos son
yield or thou diest
only i yield to die there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight kill brutus and be honourd in his death
we must not
a noble prisoner
room ho
tell antony brutus is taen
ill tell the news
here comes the general
brutus is taen brutus is taen my lord
where is he
safe antony brutus is safe enough i dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble brutus the gods defend him from so great a shame
when you do find him or alive or dead he will be found like brutus like himself
this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies
go on and see whether brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius tent how every thing is chanced
come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
statilius showd the torchlight but my lord he came not back he is or taen or slain
sit thee down clitus slaying is the word it is a deed in fashion
hark thee clitus
what i my lord
no not for all the world
peace then
no words
ill rather kill myself
hark thee dardanius
shall i do such a deed
o dardanius
o clitus
what ill request did brutus make to thee
to kill him clitus
look he meditates
now is that noble vessel full of grief that it runs over even at his eyes
come hither good volumnius list a word
what says my lord
why this volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appeard to me two several times by night at sardis once and this last night here in philippi fields i know my hour is come
not so my lord
nay i am sure it is volumnius
thou seest the world volumnius how it goes our enemies have beat us to the pit it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us
good volumnius thou knowst that we two went to school together even for that our love of old i prithee hold thou my swordhilts whilst i run on it
thats not an office for a friend my lord
fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here
farewell to you and you and you volumnius
strato thou hast been all this while asleep farewell to thee too strato
countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me
i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto
so fare you well at once for brutus tongue hath almost ended his lifes history night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest that have but labourd to attain this hour
fly my lord fly
hence
i will follow
i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it
wilt thou strato
give me your hand first
fare you well my lord
farewell good strato
caesar now be still i killd not thee with half so good a will
what man is that
my masters man
strato where is thy master
free from the bondage you are in messala the conquerors can but make a fire of him for brutus only overcame himself and no man else hath honour by his death
so brutus should be found
i thank thee brutus that thou hast proved lucilius saying true
all that served brutus i will entertain them
fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
ay if messala will prefer me to you
do so good messala
how died my master strato
i held the sword and he did run on it
octavius then take him to follow thee that did the latest service to my master
this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements so mixd in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man
according to his virtue let us use him with all respect and rites of burial
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier orderd honourably
so call the field to rest and lets away to part the glories of this happy day
when shall we three meet again in thunder lightning or in rain
when the hurlyburlys done when the battles lost and won
that will be ere the set of sun
where the place
upon the heath
there to meet with macbeth
i come graymalkin
paddock calls
anon
fair is foul and foul is fair hover through the fog and filthy air
what bloody man is that
he can report as seemeth by his plight of the revolt the newest state
this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought gainst my captivity
hail brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it
doubtful it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art
the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel for to that the multiplying villanies of nature do swarm upon himfrom the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling showd like a rebels whore but alls too weak for brave macbethwell he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel which smoked with bloody execution like valours minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps and fixd his head upon our battlements
o valiant cousin
worthy gentleman
as whence the sun gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come discomfort swells
mark king of scotland mark no sooner justice had with valour armd compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbishd arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault
dismayd not this our captains macbeth and banquo
yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
if i say sooth i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorise another golgotha i cannot tell
but i am faint my gashes cry for help
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds they smack of honour both
go get him surgeons
who comes here
the worthy thane of ross
what a haste looks through his eyes
so should he look that seems to speak things strange
god save the king
whence camest thou worthy thane
from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold
norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof confronted him with selfcomparisons point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us
great happiness
that now sweno the norways king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colmes inch ten thousand dollars to our general use
no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive our bosom interest go pronounce his present death and with his former title greet macbeth
ill see it done
what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won
where hast thou been sister
killing swine
sister where thou
a sailors wife had chestnuts in her lap and munchd and munchd and munchd give me quoth i aroint thee witch
the rumpfed ronyon cries
her husbands to aleppo gone master o the tiger but in a sieve ill thither sail and like a rat without a tail ill do ill do and ill do
ill give thee a wind
thourt kind
and i another
i myself have all the other and the very ports they blow all the quarters that they know i the shipmans card
i will drain him dry as hay sleep shall neither night nor day hang upon his penthouse lid he shall live a man forbid weary sennights nine times nine shall he dwindle peak and pine though his bark cannot be lost yet it shall be tempesttost
look what i have
show me show me
here i have a pilots thumb wreckd as homeward he did come
a drum a drum
macbeth doth come
the weird sisters hand in hand posters of the sea and land thus do go about about thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again to make up nine
peace
the charms wound up
so foul and fair a day i have not seen
how far ist calld to forres
what are these so witherd and so wild in their attire that look not like the inhabitants o the earth and yet are ont
live you
or are you aught that man may question
you seem to understand me by each at once her chappy finger laying upon her skinny lips you should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so
speak if you can what are you
all hail macbeth
hail to thee thane of glamis
all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor
all hail macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
good sir why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair
i the name of truth are ye fantastical or that indeed which outwardly ye show
my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate
hail
hail
hail
lesser than macbeth and greater
not so happy yet much happier
thou shalt get kings though thou be none so all hail macbeth and banquo
banquo and macbeth all hail
stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by sinels death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor
the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence
or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting
speak i charge you
the earth hath bubbles as the water has and these are of them
whither are they vanishd
into the air and what seemd corporal melted as breath into the wind
would they had stayd
were such things here as we do speak about
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner
your children shall be kings
you shall be king
and thane of cawdor too went it not so
to the selfsame tune and words
whos here
the king hath happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death
as thick as hail came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdoms great defence and pourd them down before him
we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks only to herald thee into his sight not pay thee
and for an earnest of a greater honour he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane
for it is thine
what can the devil speak true
the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrowd robes
who was the thane lives yet but under heavy judgment bears that life which he deserves to lose
whether he was combined with those of norway or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage or that with both he labourd in his countrys wreck i know not but treasons capital confessd and proved have overthrown him
none the greatest is behind
thanks for your pains
do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them
that trusted home might yet enkindle you unto the crown besides the thane of cawdor
but tis strange and oftentimes to win us to our harm the instruments of darkness tell us truths win us with honest trifles to betrays in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you
none as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial themei thank you gentlemen
none cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth
i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature
present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smotherd in surmise and nothing is but what is not
look how our partners rapt
none without my stir
new horrors come upon him like our strange garments cleave not to their mould but with the aid of use
none time and the hour runs through the roughest day
worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
give me your favour my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten
kind gentlemen your pains are registerd where every day i turn the leaf to read them
let us toward the king
think upon what hath chanced and at more time the interim having weighd it let us speak our free hearts each to other
very gladly
till then enough
come friends
is execution done on cawdor
are not those in commission yet returnd
my liege they are not yet come back
but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confessd his treasons implored your highness pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as twere a careless trifle
theres no art to find the minds construction in the face he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust
o worthiest cousin
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me thou art so far before that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee
would thou hadst less deserved that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine
only i have left to say more is thy due than more than all can pay
the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself
your highness part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour
welcome hither i have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee full of growing
noble banquo that hast no less deserved nor must be known no less to have done so let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart
there if i grow the harvest is your own
my plenteous joys wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow
sons kinsmen thanes and you whose places are the nearest know we will establish our estate upon our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter the prince of cumberland which honour must not unaccompanied invest him only but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine on all deservers
from hence to inverness and bind us further to you
the rest is labour which is not used for you ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave
my worthy cawdor
none on which i must fall down or else oerleap for in my way it lies
stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see
true worthy banquo he is full so valiant and in his commendations i am fed it is a banquet to me
lets after him whose care is gone before to bid us welcome it is a peerless kinsman
they met me in the day of success and i have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge
when i burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who allhailed me thane of cawdor by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with hail king that shalt be
this have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee
lay it to thy heart and farewell
glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great art not without ambition but without the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win thouldst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone
hie thee hither that i may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crownd withal
what is your tidings
the king comes here tonight
thourt mad to say it is not thy master with him
who weret so would have informd for preparation
so please you it is true our thane is coming one of my fellows had the speed of him who almost dead for breath had scarcely more than would make up his message
give him tending he brings great news
the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan under my battlements
come you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull of direst cruelty
make thick my blood stop up the access and passage to remorse that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between the effect and it
come to my womans breasts and take my milk for gall you murdering ministers wherever in your sightless substances you wait on natures mischief
come thick night and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell that my keen knife see not the wound it makes nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry hold hold
great glamis
worthy cawdor
greater than both by the allhail hereafter
thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present and i feel now the future in the instant
my dearest love duncan comes here tonight
and when goes hence
tomorrow as he purposes
o never shall sun that morrow see
your face my thane is as a book where men may read strange matters
to beguile the time look like the time bear welcome in your eye your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower but be the serpent undert
he thats coming must be provided for and you shall put this nights great business into my dispatch which shall to all our nights and days to come give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
we will speak further
only look up clear to alter favour ever is to fear leave all the rest to me
this castle hath a pleasant seat the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses
this guest of summer the templehaunting martlet does approve by his loved mansionry that the heavens breath smells wooingly here no jutty frieze buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle where they most breed and haunt i have observed the air is delicate
see see our honourd hostess
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble which still we thank as love
herein i teach you how you shall bid god ild us for your pains and thank us for your trouble
all our service in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honours deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old and the late dignities heapd up to them we rest your hermits
wheres the thane of cawdor
we coursed him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him to his home before us
fair and noble hostess we are your guest tonight
your servants ever have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt to make their audit at your highness pleasure still to return your own
give me your hand conduct me to mine host we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him
by your leave hostess
if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the beall and the endall here but here upon this bank and shoal of time weld jump the life to come
but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor this evenhanded justice commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice to our own lips
hes here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself
besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpettongued against the deep damnation of his takingoff and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind
i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other
how now
what news
he has almost suppd why have you left the chamber
hath he askd for me
know you not he has
we will proceed no further in this business he hath honourd me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon
was the hope drunk wherein you dressd yourself
hath it slept since
and wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely
from this time such i account thy love
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire
wouldst thou have that which thou esteemst the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem letting i dare not wait upon i would like the poor cat i the adage
prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none
what beast wast then that made you break this enterprise to me
when you durst do it then you were a man and to be more than what you were you would be so much more the man
nor time nor place did then adhere and yet you would make both they have made themselves and that their fitness now does unmake you
i have given suck and know how tender tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums and dashd the brains out had i so sworn as you have done to this
if we should fail
we fail
but screw your courage to the stickingplace and well not fail
when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his days hard journey soundly invite himhis two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory the warder of the brain shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death what cannot you and i perform upon the unguarded duncan
what not put upon his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt of our great quell
bring forth menchildren only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males
will it not be received when we have markd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have donet
who dares receive it other as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death
i am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat
away and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know
how goes the night boy
the moon is down i have not heard the clock
and she goes down at twelve
i taket tis later sir
hold take my sword
theres husbandry in heaven their candles are all out
take thee that too
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me and yet i would not sleep merciful powers restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose
give me my sword
whos there
a friend
what sir not yet at rest
the kings abed he hath been in unusual pleasure and sent forth great largess to your offices
this diamond he greets your wife withal by the name of most kind hostess and shut up in measureless content
being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought
alls well
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters to you they have showd some truth
i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time
at your kindst leisure
if you shall cleave to my consent when tis it shall make honour for you
so i lose none in seeking to augment it but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear i shall be counselld
good repose the while
thanks sir the like to you
go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready she strike upon the bell
get thee to bed
is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand
come let me clutch thee
i have thee not and yet i see thee still
art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight
or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw
thou marshallst me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use
mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before
theres no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes
now oer the one halfworld nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecates offerings and witherd murder alarumd by his sentinel the wolf whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost
thou sure and firmset earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it
whiles i threat he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
i go and it is done the bell invites me
hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quenchd them hath given me fire
hark
peace
it was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman which gives the sternst goodnight
he is about it the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have druggd their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die
none alack i am afraid they have awaked and tis not done
the attempt and not the deed confounds us
hark
i laid their daggers ready he could not miss em
had he not resembled my father as he slept i had donet
my husband
i have done the deed
didst thou not hear a noise
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
did not you speak
when
now
as i descended
ay
hark
who lies i the second chamber
donalbain
this is a sorry sight
a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
theres one did laugh ins sleep and one cried murder
that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressd them again to sleep
there are two lodged together
one cried god bless us
and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangmans hands
listening their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us
consider it not so deeply
but wherefore could not i pronounce amen
i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat
these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad
methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more
macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care the death of each days life sore labours bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast what do you mean
still it cried sleep no more
to all the house glamis hath murderd sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more
who was it that thus cried
why worthy thane you do unbend your noble strength to think so brainsickly of things
go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand
why did you bring these daggers from the place
they must lie there go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood
ill go no more i am afraid to think what i have done look ont again i dare not
infirm of purpose
give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil
if he do bleed ill gild the faces of the grooms withal for it must seem their guilt
whence is that knocking
how ist with me when every noise appals me
what hands are here
ha
they pluck out mine eyes
will all great neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand
no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine making the green one red
my hands are of your colour but i shame to wear a heart so white
i hear a knocking at the south entry retire we to our chamber a little water clears us of this deed how easy is it then
your constancy hath left you unattended
hark
more knocking
get on your nightgown lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts
to know my deed twere best not know myself
wake duncan with thy knocking
i would thou couldst
heres a knocking indeed
if a man were porter of hellgate he should have old turning the key
knock knock knock
whos there i the name of beelzebub
heres a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty come in time have napkins enow about you here youll sweat fort
knock knock
whos there in the other devils name
faith heres an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for gods sake yet could not equivocate to heaven o come in equivocator
knock knock knock
whos there
faith heres an english tailor come hither for stealing out of a french hose come in tailor here you may roast your goose
knock knock never at quiet
what are you
but this place is too cold for hell
ill devilporter it no further i had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire
anon anon
i pray you remember the porter
was it so late friend ere you went to bed that you do lie so late
faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things
what three things does drink especially provoke
marry sir nosepainting sleep and urine
lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night
that it did sir i the very throat on me but i requited him for his lie and i think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet i made a shift to cast him
is thy master stirring
our knocking has awaked him here he comes
good morrow noble sir
good morrow both
is the king stirring worthy thane
not yet
he did command me to call timely on him i have almost slippd the hour
ill bring you to him
i know this is a joyful trouble to you but yet tis one
the labour we delight in physics pain
this is the door
ill make so bold to call for tis my limited service
goes the king hence today
he does he did appoint so
the night has been unruly where we lay our chimneys were blown down and as they say lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird clamourd the livelong night some say the earth was feverous and did shake
twas a rough night
my young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it
o horror horror horror
tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee
whats the matter
confusion now hath made his masterpiece
most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the lords anointed temple and stole thence the life o the building
what is t you say
the life
mean you his majesty
approach the chamber and destroy your sight with a new gorgon do not bid me speak see and then speak yourselves
awake awake
ring the alarumbell
murder and treason
banquo and donalbain
malcolm
awake
shake off this downy sleep deaths counterfeit and look on death itself
up up and see the great dooms image
malcolm
banquo
as from your graves rise up and walk like sprites to countenance this horror
ring the bell
whats the business that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley the sleepers of the house
speak speak
o gentle lady tis not for you to hear what i can speak the repetition in a womans ear would murder as it fell
o banquo banquo our royal master s murderd
woe alas
what in our house
too cruel any where
dear duff i prithee contradict thyself and say it is not so
had i but died an hour before this chance i had lived a blessed time for from this instant there s nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of
what is amiss
you are and do not knowt the spring the head the fountain of your blood is stoppd the very source of it is stoppd
your royal father s murderd
o by whom
those of his chamber as it seemd had done t their hands and faces were an badged with blood so were their daggers which unwiped we found upon their pillows they stared and were distracted no mans life was to be trusted with them
o yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them
wherefore did you so
who can be wise amazed temperate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment
no man the expedition my violent love outrun the pauser reason
here lay duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature for ruins wasteful entrance there the murderers steepd in the colours of their trade their daggers unmannerly breechd with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make s love known
help me hence ho
look to the lady
none that most may claim this argument for ours
none where our fate hid in an augerhole may rush and seize us
let s away our tears are not yet brewd
none upon the foot of motion
look to the lady and when we have our naked frailties hid that suffer in exposure let us meet and question this most bloody piece of work to know it further
fears and scruples shake us in the great hand of god i stand and thence against the undivulged pretence i fight of treasonous malice
and so do i so all
lets briefly put on manly readiness and meet i the hall together
well contented
what will you do
lets not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy
ill to england
to ireland i our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer where we are theres daggers in mens smiles the near in blood the nearer bloody
this murderous shaft thats shot hath not yet lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim
therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leavetaking but shift away theres warrant in that theft which steals itself when theres no mercy left
threescore and ten i can remember well within the volume of which time i have seen hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night hath trifled former knowings
ah good father thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp ist nights predominance or the days shame that darkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it
tis unnatural even like the deed thats done
on tuesday last a falcon towering in her pride of place was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd
and duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift the minions of their race turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending gainst obedience as they would make war with mankind
tis said they eat each other
they did so to the amazement of mine eyes that lookd upont
here comes the good macduff
how goes the world sir now
why see you not
ist known who did this more than bloody deed
those that macbeth hath slain
alas the day
what good could they pretend
they were subornd malcolm and donalbain the kings two sons are stoln away and fled which puts upon them suspicion of the deed
gainst nature still
thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up thine own lifes means
then tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth
he is already named and gone to scone to be invested
where is duncans body
carried to colmekill the sacred storehouse of his predecessors and guardian of their bones
will you to scone
no cousin ill to fife
well i will thither
well may you see things well done there adieu
lest our old robes sit easier than our new
farewell father
gods benison go with you and with those that would make good of bad and friends of foes
thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all as the weird women promised and i fear thou playdst most foully fort yet it was said it should not stand in thy posterity but that myself should be the root and father of many kings
if there come truth from them as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine why by the verities on thee made good may they not be my oracles as well and set me up in hope
but hush
no more
heres our chief guest
if he had been forgotten it had been as a gap in our great feast and allthing unbecoming
tonight we hold a solemn supper sir and ill request your presence
let your highness command upon me to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie for ever knit
ride you this afternoon
ay my good lord
we should have else desired your good advice which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this days council but well take tomorrow
ist far you ride
as far my lord as will fill up the time twixt this and supper go not my horse the better i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain
fail not our feast
my lord i will not
we hear our bloody cousins are bestowd in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly
hie you to horse adieu till you return at night
goes fleance with you
ay my good lord our time does call upon s
i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs
farewell
let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till suppertime alone while then god be with you
sirrah a word with you attend those men our pleasure
they are my lord without the palace gate
bring them before us
to be thus is nothing but to be safely thusour fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feard tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety
there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antonys was by caesar
he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophetlike they haild him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren sceptre in my gripe thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding
if t be so for banquos issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murderd put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
rather than so come fate into the list
and champion me to the utterance
whos there
now go to the door and stay there till we call
was it not yesterday we spoke together
it was so please your highness
well then now have you considerd of my speeches
know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference passd in probation with you how you were borne in hand how crossd the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo
you made it known to us
i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go
are you so gospelld to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bowd you to the grave and beggard yours for ever
we are men my liege
ay in the catalogue ye go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition
from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you have a station in the file not i the worst rank of manhood say t and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect
i am one my liege whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world
and i another so weary with disasters tuggd with fortune that i would set my lie on any chance to mend it or be rid ont
both of you know banquo was your enemy
true my lord
so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my nearst of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons
we shall my lord perform what you command us
though our lives your spirits shine through you
within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time the moment ont fort must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his fathers must embrace the fate of that dark hour
resolve yourselves apart ill come to you anon
we are resolved my lord
ill call upon you straight abide within
it is concluded
banquo thy souls flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight
is banquo gone from court
ay madam but returns again tonight
say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words
madam i will
noughts had alls spent where our desire is got without content tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
how now my lord
why do you keep alone of sorriest fancies your companions making using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on
things without all remedy should be without regard whats done is done
we have scotchd the snake not killd it shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy
duncan is in his grave after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further
come on gentle my lord sleek oer your rugged looks be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honours in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are
you must leave this
o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
thou knowst that banquo and his fleance lives
but in them natures copys not eterne
theres comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloisterd flight ere to black hecates summons the shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung nights yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note
whats to be done
be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed
come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale
light thickens and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse while nights black agents to their preys do rouse
thou marvellst at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me
but who did bid thee join with us
macbeth
he needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices and what we have to do to the direction just
then stand with us
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day now spurs the lated traveller apace to gain the timely inn and near approaches the subject of our watch
hark
i hear horses
none then tis he the rest that are within the note of expectation already are i the court
his horses go about
almost a mile but he does usually so all men do from hence to the palace gate make it their walk
a light a light
tis he
stand tot
it will be rain tonight
let it come down
o treachery
fly good fleance fly fly fly
thou mayst revenge
o slave
who did strike out the light
wast not the way
theres but one down the son is fled
we have lost best half of our affair
well lets away and say how much is done
you know your own degrees sit down at first and last the hearty welcome
thanks to your majesty
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host
our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome
pronounce it for me sir to all our friends for my heart speaks they are welcome
see they encounter thee with their hearts thanks
both sides are even here ill sit i the midst be large in mirth anon well drink a measure the table round
theres blood on thy face
tis banquos then
tis better thee without than he within
is he dispatchd
my lord his throat is cut that i did for him
thou art the best o the cutthroats yet hes good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil
most royal sir fleance is scaped
then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabind cribbd confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears
but banquos safe
ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides with twenty trenched gashes on his head the least a death to nature
thanks for that there the grown serpent lies the worm thats fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for the present
get thee gone tomorrow well hear ourselves again
my royal lord you do not give the cheer the feast is sold that is not often vouchd while tis amaking tis given with welcome to feed were best at home from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony meeting were bare without it
sweet remembrancer
now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both
mayt please your highness sit
here had we now our countrys honour roofd were the graced person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance
his absence sir lays blame upon his promise
pleaset your highness to grace us with your royal company
the tables full
here is a place reserved sir
where
here my good lord
what ist that moves your highness
which of you have done this
what my good lord
thou canst not say i did it never shake thy gory locks at me
gentlemen rise his highness is not well
sit worthy friends my lord is often thus and hath been from his youth pray you keep seat the fit is momentary upon a thought he will again be well if much you note him you shall offend him and extend his passion feed and regard him not
are you a man
ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appal the devil
o proper stuff
this is the very painting of your fear this is the airdrawn dagger which you said led you to duncan
o these flaws and starts impostors to true fear would well become a womans story at a winters fire authorized by her grandam
shame itself
why do you make such faces
when alls done you look but on a stool
prithee see there
behold
look
lo
how say you
why what care i
if thou canst nod speak too
if charnelhouses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites
what quite unmannd in folly
if i stand here i saw him
fie for shame
blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time ere human statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performd too terrible for the ear the times have been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is
my worthy lord your noble friends do lack you
i do forget
do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me
come love and health to all then ill sit down
give me some wine fill full
i drink to the general joy o the whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here
to all and him we thirst and all to all
our duties and the pledge
avaunt
and quit my sight
let the earth hide thee
thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with
think of this good peers but as a thing of custom tis no other only it spoils the pleasure of the time
what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armd rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl
hence horrible shadow
unreal mockery hence
why so being gone i am a man again
pray you sit still
you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting with most admired disorder
can such things be and overcome us like a summers cloud without our special wonder
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear
what sights my lord
i pray you speak not he grows worse and worse question enrages him
at once good night stand not upon the order of your going but go at once
good night and better health attend his majesty
a kind good night to all
it will have blood they say blood will have blood stones have been known to move and trees to speak augurs and understood relations have by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secretst man of blood
what is the night
almost at odds with morning which is which
how sayst thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding
did you send to him sir
i hear it by the way but i will send theres not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant feed
i will tomorrow and betimes i will to the weird sisters more shall they speak for now i am bent to know by the worst means the worst
for mine own good all causes shall give way i am in blood steppd in so far that should i wade no more returning were as tedious as go oer strange things i have in head that will to hand which must be acted ere they may be scannd
you lack the season of all natures sleep
come well to sleep
my strange and selfabuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use we are yet but young in deed
why how now hecate
you look angerly
have i not reason beldams as you are saucy and overbold
how did you dare to trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death and i the mistress of your charms the close contriver of all harms was never calld to bear my part or show the glory of our art
and which is worse all you have done hath been but for a wayward son spiteful and wrathful who as others do loves for his own ends not for you
but make amends now get you gone and at the pit of acheron meet me i the morning thither he will come to know his destiny your vessels and your spells provide your charms and every thing beside
i am for the air this night ill spend unto a dismal and a fatal end great business must be wrought ere noon upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vaporous drop profound ill catch it ere it come to ground and that distilld by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear he hopes bove wisdom grace and fear and you all know security is mortals chiefest enemy
hark
i am calld my little spirit see sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
come lets make haste shell soon be back again
my former speeches have but hit your thoughts which can interpret further only i say things have been strangely borne
the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead and the rightvaliant banquo walkd too late whom you may say ift please you fleance killd for fleance fled men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father
damned fact
how it did grieve macbeth
did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
was not that nobly done
ay and wisely too for twould have angerd any heart alive to hear the men denyt
so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncans sons under his key as ant please heaven he shall notthey should find what twere to kill a father so should fleance
but peace
for from broad words and cause he faild his presence at the tyrants feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell where he bestows himself
the son of duncan from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward that by the help of thesewith him above to ratify the workwe may again give to our tables meat sleep to our nights free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives do faithful homage and receive free honours all which we pine for now and this report hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war
sent he to macduff
he did and with an absolute sir not i the cloudy messenger turns me his back and hums as who should say youll rue the time that clogs me with this answer
and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide
some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed
ill send my prayers with him
thrice the brinded cat hath mewd
thrice and once the hedgepig whined
harpier cries tis time tis time
round about the cauldron go in the poisond entrails throw
toad that under cold stone days and nights has thirtyone swelterd venom sleeping got boil thou first i the charmed pot
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
fillet of a fenny snake in the cauldron boil and bake eye of newt and toe of frog wool of bat and tongue of dog adders fork and blindworms sting lizards leg and owlets wing for a charm of powerful trouble like a hellbroth boil and bubble
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
scale of dragon tooth of wolf witches mummy maw and gulf of the ravind saltsea shark root of hemlock diggd i the dark liver of blaspheming jew gall of goat and slips of yew silverd in the moons eclipse nose of turk and tartars lips finger of birthstrangled babe ditchdeliverd by a drab make the gruel thick and slab add thereto a tigers chaudron for the ingredients of our cauldron
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
cool it with a baboons blood then the charm is firm and good
o well done
i commend your pains and every one shall share i the gains and now about the cauldron sing live elves and fairies in a ring enchanting all that you put in
by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes
open locks whoever knocks
how now you secret black and midnight hags
what ist you do
a deed without a name
i conjure you by that which you profess howeer you come to know it answer me though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches though the yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down though castles topple on their warders heads though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations though the treasure of natures germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken answer me to what i ask you
speak
demand
well answer
say if thoudst rather hear it from our mouths or from our masters
call em let me see em
pour in sows blood that hath eaten her nine farrow grease thats sweaten from the murderers gibbet throw into the flame
come high or low thyself and office deftly show
tell me thou unknown power he knows thy thought hear his speech but say thou nought
macbeth
macbeth
macbeth
beware macduff beware the thane of fife
dismiss me
enough
whateer thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harpd my fear aright but one word more he will not be commanded heres another more potent than the first
macbeth
macbeth
macbeth
had i three ears ild hear thee
be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn the power of man for none of woman born shall harm macbeth
then live macduff what need i fear of thee
but yet ill make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live that i may tell palehearted fear it lies and sleep in spite of thunder
what is this that rises like the issue of a king and wears upon his babybrow the round and top of sovereignty
listen but speak not tot
be lionmettled proud and take no care who chafes who frets or where conspirers are macbeth shall never vanquishd be until great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill shall come against him
that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earthbound root
sweet bodements
good
rebellions head rise never till the wood of birnam rise and our highplaced macbeth shall live the lease of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom
yet my heart throbs to know one thing tell me if your art can tell so much shall banquos issue ever reign in this kingdom
seek to know no more
i will be satisfied deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you
let me know
why sinks that cauldron
and what noise is this
show
show
show
show his eyes and grieve his heart come like shadows so depart
thou art too like the spirit of banquo down
thy crown does sear mine eyeballs
and thy hair thou other goldbound brow is like the first
a third is like the former
filthy hags
why do you show me this
a fourth
start eyes
what will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
another yet
a seventh
ill see no more and yet the eighth appears who bears a glass which shows me many more and some i see that twofold balls and treble scepters carry horrible sight
now i see tis true for the bloodbolterd banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his
what is this so
ay sir all this is so but why stands macbeth thus amazedly
come sisters cheer we up his sprites and show the best of our delights ill charm the air to give a sound while you perform your antic round that this great king may kindly say our duties did his welcome pay
where are they
gone
let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar
come in without there
whats your graces will
saw you the weird sisters
no my lord
came they not by you
no indeed my lord
infected be the air whereon they ride and damnd all those that trust them
i did hear the galloping of horse who wast came by
tis two or three my lord that bring you word macduff is fled to england
fled to england
ay my good lord
time thou anticipatest my dread exploits the flighty purpose never is oertook unless the deed go with it from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand
and even now to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done the castle of macduff i will surprise seize upon fife give to the edge o the sword his wife his babes and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line
no boasting like a fool this deed ill do before this purpose cool
but no more sightswhere are these gentlemen
come bring me where they are
what had he done to make him fly the land
you must have patience madam
he had none his flight was madness when our actions do not our fears do make us traitors
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear
wisdom
to leave his wife to leave his babes his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly
he loves us not he wants the natural touch for the poor wren the most diminutive of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl
all is the fear and nothing is the love as little is the wisdom where the flight so runs against all reason
my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o the season
i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move
i take my leave of you shall not be long but ill be here again things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before
my pretty cousin blessing upon you
fatherd he is and yet hes fatherless
i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once
sirrah your fathers dead and what will you do now
how will you live
as birds do mother
what with worms and flies
with what i get i mean and so do they
poor bird
thouldst never fear the net nor lime the pitfall nor the gin
why should i mother
poor birds they are not set for
my father is not dead for all your saying
yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
nay how will you do for a husband
why i can buy me twenty at any market
then youll buy em to sell again
thou speakst with all thy wit and yet i faith with wit enough for thee
was my father a traitor mother
ay that he was
what is a traitor
why one that swears and lies
and be all traitors that do so
every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie
every one
who must hang them
why the honest men
then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them
now god help thee poor monkey
but how wilt thou do for a father
if he were dead yould weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father
poor prattler how thou talkst
bless you fair dame
i am not to you known though in your state of honour i am perfect
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you will take a homely mans advice be not found here hence with your little ones
to fright you thus methinks i am too savage to do worse to you were fell cruelty which is too nigh your person
heaven preserve you
i dare abide no longer
whither should i fly
i have done no harm
but i remember now i am in this earthly world where to do harm is often laudable to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then alas do i put up that womanly defence to say i have done no harm
what are these faces
where is your husband
i hope in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him
hes a traitor
thou liest thou shaghaird villain
what you egg
young fry of treachery
he has killd me mother run away i pray you
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows strike heaven on the face that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yelld out like syllable of dolour
what i believe ill wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well
he hath not touchd you yet
i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god
i am not treacherous
but macbeth is
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge
but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so
i have lost my hopes
perchance even there where i did find my doubts
why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leavetaking
i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties
you may be rightly just whatever i shall think
bleed bleed poor country
great tyranny
lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou thy wrongs the title is affeerd
fare thee well lord i would not be the villain that thou thinkst for the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp and the rich east to boot
be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrants head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed
what should he be
it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be opend black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd in evils to top macbeth
i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but theres no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would oerbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign
boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
we have willing dames enough there cannot be that vulture in you to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves finding it so inclined
with this there grows in my most illcomposed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this others house and my morehaving would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth
this avarice sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root than summerseeming lust and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
of your mere own all these are portable with other graces weighd
but i have none the kingbecoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways
nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth
o scotland scotland
if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken
fit to govern
no not to live
o nation miserable with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed and does blaspheme his breed
thy royal father was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee oftener upon her knees than on her feet died every day she lived
fare thee well
these evils thou repeatst upon thyself have banishd me from scotland
o my breast thy hope ends here
macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour
devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from overcredulous haste but god above deal between thee and me
for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature
i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn scarcely have coveted what was mine own at no time broke my faith would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself what i am truly is thine and my poor countrys to command whither indeed before thy hereapproach old siward with ten thousand warlike men already at a point was setting forth
now well together and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel
why are you silent
such welcome and unwelcome things at once tis hard to reconcile
well more anoncomes the king forth i pray you
ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure their malady convinces the great assay of art but at his touch such sanctity hath heaven given his hand they presently amend
i thank you doctor
whats the disease he means
tis calld the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my hereremain in england i have seen him do
how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangelyvisited people all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction
with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace
see who comes here
my countryman but yet i know him not
my evergentle cousin welcome hither
i know him now
good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers
sir amen
stands scotland where it did
alas poor country
almost afraid to know itself
it cannot be calld our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not markd where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy the dead mans knell is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken
o relation too nice and yet too true
whats the newest grief
that of an hours age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one
how does my wife
why well
and all my children
well too
the tyrant has not batterd at their peace
no they were well at peace when i did leave em
but not a niggard of your speech how goest
when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witnessd the rather for that i saw the tyrants power afoot now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses
bet their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out
would i could answer this comfort with the like
but i have words that would be howld out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them
what concern they
the general cause
or is it a feegrief due to some single breast
no mind thats honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone
if it be mine keep it not from me quickly let me have it
let not your ears despise my tongue for ever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard
hum
i guess at it
your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughterd to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murderd deer to add the death of you
merciful heaven
what man
neer pull your hat upon your brows give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break
my children too
wife children servants all that could be found
and i must be from thence
my wife killd too
i have said
be comforted lets make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief
he has no children
all my pretty ones
did you say all
o hellkite
all
what all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop
dispute it like a man
i shall do so but i must also feel it as a man i cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me
did heaven look on and would not take their part
sinful macduff they were all struck for thee
naught that i am not for their own demerits but for mine fell slaughter on their souls
heaven rest them now
be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
o i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue
but gentle heavens cut short all intermission front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself within my swords length set him if he scape heaven forgive him too
this tune goes manly
come go we to the king our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments
receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day
i have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report
when was it she last walked
since his majesty went into the field i have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upont read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
a great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching
in this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say
that sir which i will not report after her
you may to me and tis most meet you should
neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech
lo you here she comes
this is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep
observe her stand close
how came she by that light
why it stood by her she has light by her continually tis her command
you see her eyes are open
ay but their sense is shut
what is it she does now
look how she rubs her hands
it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour
yet heres a spot
hark
she speaks i will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
out damned spot
out i sayone two why then tis time to dothell is murkyfie my lord fie
a soldier and afeard
what need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to accountyet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him
do you mark that
the thane of fife had a wife where is she now what will these hands neer be cleanno more o that my lord no more o that you mar all with this starting
go to go to you have known what you should not
she has spoke what she should not i am sure of that heaven knows what she has known
heres the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand
oh oh oh
what a sigh is there
the heart is sorely charged
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body
well well well pray god it be sir
this disease is beyond my practise yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds
wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so palei tell you yet again banquos buried he cannot come out ons grave
even so
to bed to bed
theres knocking at the gate come come come come give me your hand
whats done cannot be undoneto bed to bed to bed
will she go now to bed
directly
foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets more needs she the divine than the physician
god god forgive us all
look after her remove from her the means of all annoyance and still keep eyes upon her
so good night my mind she has mated and amazed my sight
i think but dare not speak
good night good doctor
the english power is near led on by malcolm his uncle siward and the good macduff revenges burn in them for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man
near birnam wood shall we well meet them that way are they coming
who knows if donalbain be with his brother
for certain sir he is not i have a file of all the gentry there is siwards son and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood
what does the tyrant
great dunsinane he strongly fortifies some say hes mad others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distemperd cause within the belt of rule
now does he feel his secret murders sticking on his hands now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach those he commands move only in command nothing in love now does he feel his title hang loose about him like a giants robe upon a dwarfish thief
who then shall blame his pesterd senses to recoil and start when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there
well march we on to give obedience where tis truly owed meet we the medicine of the sickly weal and with him pour we in our countrys purge each drop of us
or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
make we our march towards birnam
bring me no more reports let them fly all till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i cannot taint with fear
whats the boy malcolm
was he not born of woman
the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus fear not macbeth no man thats born of woman shall eer have power upon thee
then fly false thanes and mingle with the english epicures the mind i sway by and the heart i bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
the devil damn thee black thou creamfaced loon
where gotst thou that goose look
there is ten thousand geese villain
soldiers sir
go prick thy face and overred thy fear thou lilyliverd boy
what soldiers patch
death of thy soul
those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear
what soldiers wheyface
the english force so please you
take thy face hence
seytoni am sick at heart when i beholdseyton i saythis push will cheer me ever or disseat me now
i have lived long enough my way of life is falln into the sear the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honour love obedience troops of friends i must not look to have but in their stead curses not loud but deep mouthhonour breath which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
seyton
what is your gracious pleasure
what news more
all is confirmd my lord which was reported
ill fight till from my bones my flesh be hackd
give me my armour
tis not needed yet
ill put it on
send out more horses skirr the country round hang those that talk of fear
give me mine armour
how does your patient doctor
not so sick my lord as she is troubled with thick coming fancies that keep her from her rest
cure her of that
canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart
therein the patient must minister to himself
throw physic to the dogs ill none of it
come put mine armour on give me my staff
seyton send out
doctor the thanes fly from me
come sir dispatch
if thou couldst doctor cast the water of my land find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health i would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud againpullt off i say what rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug would scour these english hence
hearst thou of them
ay my good lord your royal preparation makes us hear something
bring it after me
i will not be afraid of death and bane till birnam forest come to dunsinane
none profit again should hardly draw me here
cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe
we doubt it nothing
what wood is this before us
the wood of birnam
let every soldier hew him down a bough and beart before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us
it shall be done
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before t
tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too
let our just censures attend the true event and put we on industrious soldiership
the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate but certain issue strokes must arbitrate towards which advance the war
hang out our banners on the outward walls the cry is still they come our castles strength will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up were they not forced with those that should be ours we might have met them dareful beard to beard and beat them backward home
what is that noise
it is the cry of women my good lord
i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have coold to hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were int i have suppd full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me
wherefore was that cry
the queen my lord is dead
she should have died hereafter there would have been a time for such a word
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death
out out brief candle
lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
gracious my lord i should report that which i say i saw but know not how to do it
well say sir
as i did stand my watch upon the hill i lookd toward birnam and anon methought the wood began to move
liar and slave
let me endure your wrath ift be not so within this three mile may you see it coming i say a moving grove
if thou speakst false upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou dost for me as much
i pull in resolution and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood do come to dunsinane  and now a wood comes toward dunsinane
arm arm and out
if this which he avouches does appear there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
i gin to be aweary of the sun and wish the estate o the world were now undone
ring the alarumbell
blow wind
come wrack
at least well die with harness on our back
now near enough your leafy screens throw down
and show like those you are
you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your rightnoble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon s what else remains to do according to our order
fare you well
do we but find the tyrants power tonight let us be beaten if we cannot fight
make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous harbingers of blood and death
they have tied me to a stake i cannot fly but bearlike i must fight the course
whats he that was not born of woman
such a one am i to fear or none
what is thy name
thoult be afraid to hear it
no though thou callst thyself a hotter name than any is in hell
my names macbeth
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear
no nor more fearful
thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword ill prove the lie thou speakst
thou wast born of woman but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn brandishd by man thats of a woman born
that way the noise is
tyrant show thy face
if thou best slain and with no stroke of mine my wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
i cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms are hired to bear their staves either thou macbeth or else my sword with an unbatterd edge i sheathe again undeeded
there thou shouldst be by this great clatter one of greatest note seems bruited
let me find him fortune
and more i beg not
this way my lord the castles gently renderd the tyrants people on both sides do fight the noble thanes do bravely in the war the day almost itself professes yours and little is to do
we have met with foes that strike beside us
enter sir the castle
why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword
whiles i see lives the gashes do better upon them
turn hellhound turn
of all men else i have avoided thee but get thee back my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already
i have no words my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out
thou losest labour as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charmed life which must not yield to one of woman born
despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee macduff was from his mothers womb untimely rippd
accursed be that tongue that tells me so for it hath cowd my better part of man
and be these juggling fiends no more believed that palter with us in a double sense that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope
ill not fight with thee
then yield thee coward and live to be the show and gaze o the time well have thee as our rarer monsters are painted on a pole and underwrit here may you see the tyrant
i will not yield to kiss the ground before young malcolms feet and to be baited with the rabbles curse
though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed being of no woman born yet i will try the last
before my body i throw my warlike shield
lay on macduff and damnd be him that first cries hold enough
i would the friends we miss were safe arrived
some must go off and yet by these i see so great a day as this is cheaply bought
macduff is missing and your noble son
your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt he only lived but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirmd in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died
then he is dead
ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth for then it hath no end
had he his hurts before
ay on the front
why then gods soldier be he
had i as many sons as i have hairs i would not wish them to a fairer death and so his knell is knolld
hes worth more sorrow and that ill spend for him
hes worth no more they say he parted well and paid his score and so god be with him
here comes newer comfort
hail king
for so thou art behold where stands the usurpers cursed head the time is free i see thee compassd with thy kingdoms pearl that speak my salutation in their minds whose voices i desire aloud with mine hail king of scotland
hail king of scotland
we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you
my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honour named
whats more to do which would be planted newly with the time as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen who as tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crownd at scone
in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a wantwit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself
your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings
believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad
i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad
my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do
i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand vailing her hightop lower than her ribs to kiss her burial
should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing
shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad
but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise
believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
why then you are in love
fie fie
not in love neither
then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad
now by twoheaded janus nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper and other of such vinegar aspect that theyll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable
here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo
fare ye well we leave you now with better company
i would have stayd till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me
your worth is very dear in my regard
i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart
good morrow my good lords
good signiors both when shall we laugh
say when
you grow exceeding strange must it be so
well make our leisures to attend on yours
my lord bassanio since you have found antonio we two will leave you but at dinnertime i pray you have in mind where we must meet
i will not fail you
you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously changed
i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one
let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans
why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish
i tell thee what antonio i love thee and it is my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressd in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark
o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools
ill tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion
come good lorenzo
fare ye well awhile ill end my exhortation after dinner
well we will leave you then till dinnertime i must be one of these same dumb wise men for gratiano never lets me speak
well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
farewell ill grow a talker for this gear
thanks i faith for silence is only commendable in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible
is that any thing now
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice
his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search
well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of
tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged
to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe
i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlockd to your occasions
in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence
i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first
you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak
in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to catos daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand and many jasons come in quest of her
o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate
thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rackd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia
go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake
by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world
you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing
it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer
good sentences and well pronounced
they would be better if well followed
if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching
the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband
o me the word choose
i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father
is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love
but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come
i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection
first there is the neapolitan prince
ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself
i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith
then there is the county palatine
he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth
i had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these
god defend me from these two
how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he
why he hath a horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands
if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him
what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england
you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow
how oddly he is suited
i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where
what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another
how like you the young german the duke of saxonys nephew
very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him
if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him
therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it
i will do any thing nerissa ere ill be married to a sponge
you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets
if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my fathers will
i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure
do you not remember lady in your fathers time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat
yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called
true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise
how now
what news
the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me
come nerissa
sirrah go before
whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer another knocks at the door
three thousand ducats well
ay sir for three months
for three months well
for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
antonio shall become bound well
may you stead me
will you pleasure me
shall i know your answer
three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
your answer to that
antonio is a good man
have you heard any imputation to the contrary
oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient
yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad
but ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks
the man is notwithstanding sufficient
three thousand ducats i think i may take his bond
be assured you may
i will be assured i may and that i may be assured i will bethink me
may i speak with antonio
if it please you to dine with us
yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into
i will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you
what news on the rialto
who is he comes here
this is signior antonio
none i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice
if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
he hates our sacred nation and he rails even there where merchants most do congregate on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift which he calls interest
cursed be my tribe if i forgive him
shylock do you hear
i am debating of my present store and by the near guess of my memory i cannot instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats
what of that
tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe will furnish me
but soft
how many months do you desire
rest you fair good signior your worship was the last man in our mouths
shylock although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend ill break a custom
is he yet possessd how much ye would
ay ay three thousand ducats
and for three months
i had forgot three months you told me so
well then your bond and let me see but hear you methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage
i do never use it
when jacob grazed his uncle labans sheep this jacob from our holy abram was as his wise mother wrought in his behalf the third possessor ay he was the third and what of him
did he take interest
no not take interest not as you would say directly interest mark what jacob did
when laban and himself were compromised that all the eanlings which were streakd and pied should fall as jacobs hire the ewes being rank in the end of autumn turned to the rams and when the work of generation was between these woolly breeders in the act the skilful shepherd peeld me certain wands and in the doing of the deed of kind he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes who then conceiving did in eaning time fall particolourd lambs and those were jacobs
this was a way to thrive and he was blest and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven
was this inserted to make interest good
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
i cannot tell i make it breed as fast but note me signior
mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
three months from twelve then let me see the rate well shylock shall we be beholding to you
signior antonio many a time and oft in the rialto you have rated me about my moneys and my usances still have i borne it with a patient shrug for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
you call me misbeliever cutthroat dog and spit upon my jewish gaberdine and all for use of that which is mine own
well then it now appears you need my help go to then you come to me and you say shylock we would have moneys you say so you that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold moneys is your suit what should i say to you
should i not say hath a dog money
is it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats
or shall i bend low and in a bondmans key with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this fair sir you spit on me on wednesday last you spurnd me such a day another time you calld me dog and for these courtesies ill lend you thus much moneys
i am as like to call thee so again to spit on thee again to spurn thee too
if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend
but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty
why look you how you storm
i would be friends with you and have your love forget the shames that you have staind me with supply your present wants and take no doit of usance for my moneys and youll not hear me this is kind i offer
this were kindness
this kindness will i show
go with me to a notary seal me there your single bond and in a merry sport if you repay me not on such a day in such a place such sum or sums as are expressd in the condition let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me
content i faith ill seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew
you shall not seal to such a bond for me ill rather dwell in my necessity
why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months thats a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond
o father abram what these christians are whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others
pray you tell me this if he should break his day what should i gain by the exaction of the forfeiture
a pound of mans flesh taken from a man is not so estimable profitable neither as flesh of muttons beefs or goats
i say to buy his favour i extend this friendship if he will take it so if not adieu and for my love i pray you wrong me not
yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
then meet me forthwith at the notarys give him direction for this merry bond and i will go and purse the ducats straight see to my house left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave and presently i will be with you
hie thee gentle jew
the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
i like not fair terms and a villains mind
come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day
mislike me not for my complexion the shadowd livery of the burnishd sun to whom i am a neighbour and near bred
bring me the fairest creature northward born where phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles and let us make incision for your love to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
i tell thee lady this aspect of mine hath feard the valiant by my love i swear the bestregarded virgins of our clime have loved it too i would not change this hue except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maidens eyes besides the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renowned prince then stood as fair as any comer i have lookd on yet for my affection
even for that i thank you therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets to try my fortune
by this scimitar that slew the sophy and a persian prince that won three fields of sultan solyman i would outstare the sternest eyes that look outbrave the heart most daring on the earth pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear yea mock the lion when he roars for prey to win thee lady
but alas the while
if hercules and lichas play at dice which is the better man the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand so is alcides beaten by his page and so may i blind fortune leading me miss that which one unworthier may attain and die with grieving
you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised
nor will not
come bring me unto my chance
first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made
good fortune then
to make me blest or cursedst among men
certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this jew my master
the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me gobbo launcelot gobbo good launcelot or good gobbo or good launcelot gobbo use your legs take the start run away

signior bassanio hear me if i do not put on a sober habit talk with respect and swear but now and then wear prayerbooks in my pocket look demurely nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes thus with my hat and sigh and say amen use all the observance of civility like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam never trust me more

the patch is kind enough but a huge feeder snailslow in profit and he sleeps by day more than the wildcat drones hive not with me therefore i part with him and part with him to one that would have him help to waste his borrowd purse
well jessica go in perhaps i will return immediately do as i bid you shut doors after you fast bind fast find a proverb never stale in thrifty mind
farewell and if my fortune be not crost i have a father you a daughter lost
this is the penthouse under which lorenzo desired us to make stand
his hour is almost past
and it is marvel he outdwells his hour for lovers ever run before the clock
o ten times faster venus pigeons fly to seal loves bonds newmade than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited
that ever holds who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down
where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first
all things that are are with more spirit chased than enjoyd
how like a younker or a prodigal the scarfed bark puts from her native bay huggd and embraced by the strumpet wind
how like the prodigal doth she return with overweatherd ribs and ragged sails lean rent and beggard by the strumpet wind
here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter
sweet friends your patience for my long abode not i but my affairs have made you wait when you shall please to play the thieves for wives ill watch as long for you then
approach here dwells my father jew
ho
whos within
who are you
tell me for more certainty albeit ill swear that i do know your tongue
lorenzo and thy love
lorenzo certain and my love indeed for who love i so much
and now who knows but you lorenzo whether i am yours
heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
here catch this casket it is worth the pains
i am glad tis night you do not look on me for i am much ashamed of my exchange but love is blind and lovers cannot see the pretty follies that themselves commit for if they could cupid himself would blush to see me thus transformed to a boy
descend for you must be my torchbearer
what must i hold a candle to my shames
they in themselves goodsooth are too too light
why tis an office of discovery love and i should be obscured
so are you sweet even in the lovely garnish of a boy
but come at once for the close night doth play the runaway and we are stayd for at bassanios feast
i will make fast the doors and gild myself with some more ducats and be with you straight
now by my hood a gentile and no jew
beshrew me but i love her heartily for she is wise if i can judge of her and fair she is if that mine eyes be true and true she is as she hath proved herself and therefore like herself wise fair and true shall she be placed in my constant soul
what art thou come
on gentlemen away
our masquing mates by this time for us stay
whos there
signior antonio
fie fie gratiano
where are all the rest
tis nine oclock our friends all stay for you
no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard i have sent twenty out to seek for you
i am glad ont i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight
go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince
now make your choice
the first of gold who this inscription bears who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire the second silver which this promise carries who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves this third dull lead with warning all as blunt who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
how shall i know if i do choose the right
the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal
some god direct my judgment
let me see i will survey the inscriptions back again
what says this leaden casket
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
must give for what
for lead
hazard for lead
this casket threatens
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross ill then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
what says the silver with her virgin hue
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
as much as he deserves
pause there morocco and weigh thy value with an even hand if thou best rated by thy estimation thou dost deserve enough and yet enough may not extend so far as to the lady and yet to be afeard of my deserving were but a weak disabling of myself
as much as i deserve
why thats the lady i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes in graces and in qualities of breeding but more than these in love i do deserve
what if i strayd no further but chose here
lets see once more this saying graved in gold who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
why thats the lady all the world desires her from the four corners of the earth they come to kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now for princes to come view fair portia the watery kingdom whose ambitious head spits in the face of heaven is no bar to stop the foreign spirits but they come as oer a brook to see fair portia
one of these three contains her heavenly picture
ist like that lead contains her
twere damnation to think so base a thought it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
or shall i think in silver shes immured being ten times undervalued to tried gold
o sinful thought
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold
they have in england a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold but thats insculpd upon but here an angel in a golden bed lies all within
deliver me the key here do i choose and thrive i as i may
there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours
o hell
what have we here
a carrion death within whose empty eye there is a written scroll
ill read the writing
all that glitters is not gold often have you heard that told many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold gilded tombs do worms enfold
had you been as wise as bold young in limbs in judgment old your answer had not been inscrolld fare you well your suit is cold
cold indeed and labour lost then farewell heat and welcome frost
portia adieu
i have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave thus losers part
a gentle riddance
draw the curtains go
let all of his complexion choose me so
why man i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
the villain jew with outcries raised the duke who went with him to search bassanios ship
he came too late the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica besides antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship
i never heard a passion so confused so strange outrageous and so variable as the dog jew did utter in the streets my daughter
o my ducats
o my daughter
fled with a christian
o my christian ducats
justice
the law
my ducats and my daughter
a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones stolen by my daughter
justice
find the girl she hath the stones upon her and the ducats
why all the boys in venice follow him crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
let good antonio look he keep his day or he shall pay for this
marry well rememberd
i reasond with a frenchman yesterday who told me in the narrow seas that part the french and english there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught i thought upon antonio when he told me and wishd in silence that it were not his
you were best to tell antonio what you hear yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return he answerd do not so slubber not business for my sake bassanio but stay the very riping of the time and for the jews bond which he hath of me let it not enter in your mind of love be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanios hand and so they parted
i think he only loves the world for him
i pray thee let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other
do we so
quick quick i pray thee draw the curtain straight the prince of arragon hath taen his oath and comes to his election presently
behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am containd straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately
i am enjoind by oath to observe three things first never to unfold to any one which casket twas i chose next if i fail of the right casket never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly if i do fail in fortune of my choice immediately to leave you and be gone
to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self
and so have i addressd me
fortune now to my hearts hope
gold silver and base lead
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath
you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
what says the golden chest
ha
let me see who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
what many men desire
that many may be meant by the fool multitude that choose by show not learning more than the fond eye doth teach which pries not to the interior but like the martlet builds in the weather on the outward wall even in the force and road of casualty
i will not choose what many men desire because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse tell me once more what title thou dost bear who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves and well said too for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honourable without the stamp of merit
let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity
o that estates degrees and offices were not derived corruptly and that clear honour were purchased by the merit of the wearer
how many then should cover that stand bare
how many be commanded that command
how much low peasantry would then be gleand from the true seed of honour
and how much honour pickd from the chaff and ruin of the times to be newvarnishd
well but to my choice who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
i will assume desert
give me a key for this and instantly unlock my fortunes here
too long a pause for that which you find there
whats here
the portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule
i will read it
how much unlike art thou to portia
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves
did i deserve no more than a fools head
is that my prize
are my deserts no better
to offend and judge are distinct offices and of opposed natures
what is here
the fire seven times tried this seven times tried that judgment is that did never choose amiss
some there be that shadows kiss such have but a shadows bliss there be fools alive i wis silverd oer and so was this
take what wife you will to bed i will ever be your head so be gone you are sped
still more fool i shall appear by the time i linger here with one fools head i came to woo but i go away with two
sweet adieu
ill keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth
thus hath the candle singed the moth
o these deliberate fools
when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose
the ancient saying is no heresy hanging and wiving goes by destiny
come draw the curtain nerissa
where is my lady
here what would my lord
madam there is alighted at your gate a young venetian one that comes before to signify the approaching of his lord from whom he bringeth sensible regreets to wit besides commends and courteous breath gifts of rich value
yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love a day in april never came so sweet to show how costly summer was at hand as this forespurrer comes before his lord
no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spendst such highday wit in praising him
come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupids post that comes so mannerly
bassanio lord love if thy will it be
now what news on the rialto
why yet it lives there uncheckd that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband
but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the honest antonioo that i had a title good enough to keep his name company come the full stop
ha
what sayest thou
why the end is he hath lost a ship
i would it might prove the end of his losses
let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
how now shylock
what news among the merchants
you know none so well none so well as you of my daughters flight
thats certain i for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal
and shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam
she is damned for it
thats certain if the devil may be her judge
my own flesh and blood to rebel
out upon it old carrion
rebels it at these years
i say my daughter is my flesh and blood
there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish
but tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no
there i have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond he was wont to lend money for a christian courtesy let him look to his bond
why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh whats that good for
to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it will feed my revenge
he hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million laughed at my losses mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies and whats his reason
i am a jew
hath not a jew eyes
hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions
fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian is
if you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us shall we not revenge
if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that
if a jew wrong a christian what is his humility
revenge
if a christian wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by christian example
why revenge
the villany you teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction
gentlemen my master antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both
we have been up and down to seek him
here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn jew
how now tubal
what news from genoa
hast thou found my daughter
i often came where i did hear of her but cannot find her
why there there there there
a diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in frankfort
the curse never fell upon our nation till now i never felt it till now two thousand ducats in that and other precious precious jewels
i would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin
no news of them
why so and i know not whats spent in the search why thou loss upon loss
the thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my shoulders no sighs but of my breathing no tears but of my shedding
yes other men have ill luck too antonio as i heard in genoa what what what
ill luck ill luck
hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis
i thank god i thank god
ist true ist true
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck
i thank thee good tubal good news good news
ha ha
where
in genoa
your daughter spent in genoa as i heard in one night fourscore ducats
thou stickest a dagger in me i shall never see my gold again fourscore ducats at a sitting
fourscore ducats
there came divers of antonios creditors in my company to venice that swear he cannot choose but break
i am very glad of it ill plague him ill torture him i am glad of it
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey
out upon her
thou torturest me tubal it was my turquoise i had it of leah when i was a bachelor i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
but antonio is certainly undone
nay thats true thats very true
go tubal fee me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before
i will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of venice i can make what merchandise i will
go go tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good tubal at our synagogue tubal
i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear awhile
theres something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality
but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me
i could teach you how to choose right but i am then forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do youll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn
beshrew your eyes they have oerlookd me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours
o these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights
and so though yours not yours
prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but tis to peize the time to eke it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election
let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack
upon the rack bassanio
then confess what treason there is mingled with your love
none but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love
ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything
promise me life and ill confess the truth
well then confess and live
confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance
but let me to my fortune and the caskets
away then
i am lockd in one of them if you do love me you will find me out
nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and watery deathbed for him
he may win and what is music then
then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a newcrowned monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear and summon him to marriage
now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of the exploit
go hercules
live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray
tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head
how begot how nourished
reply reply
it is engenderd in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancys knell ill begin itding dong bell
ding dong bell
so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament
in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil
in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament
there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searchd have livers white as milk and these assume but valours excrement to render them redoubted
look on beauty and you shall see tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest
therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence
none as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy
o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein thy joy scant this excess
i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit
what find i here
fair portias counterfeit
what demigod hath come so near creation
move these eyes
or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion
here are severd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends
here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them
having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnishd
yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance
heres the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune
you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true
since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss
a gentle scroll
fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive
like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmd signd ratified by you
you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractised happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king
myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen oer myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you
madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy expressd and not expressd
but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanios dead
my lord and lady it is now our time that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too
with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
i thank your lordship you have got me one
my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress i beheld the maid you loved i loved for intermission
no more pertains to me my lord than you
your fortune stood upon the casket there and so did mine too as the matter falls for wooing here until i sweat again and sweating until my very roof was dry with oaths of love at last if promise last i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love provided that your fortune achieved her mistress
is this true nerissa
madam it is so you stand pleased withal
and do you gratiano mean good faith
yes faith my lord
our feast shall be much honourd in your marriage
well play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
what and stake down
no we shall neer win at that sport and stake down
but who comes here
lorenzo and his infidel
what and my old venetian friend salerio
lorenzo and salerio welcome hither if that the youth of my new interest here have power to bid you welcome
by your leave i bid my very friends and countrymen sweet portia welcome
so do i my lord they are entirely welcome
i thank your honour
for my part my lord my purpose was not to have seen you here but meeting with salerio by the way he did entreat me past all saying nay to come with him along
i did my lord and i have reason for it
signior antonio commends him to you
ere i ope his letter i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
not sick my lord unless it be in mind nor well unless in mind his letter there will show you his estate
nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
your hand salerio whats the news from venice
how doth that royal merchant good antonio
i know he will be glad of our success we are the jasons we have won the fleece
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper that steals the colour from bassanios cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man
what worse and worse
with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you
o sweet portia here are a few of the unpleasantst words that ever blotted paper
gentle lady when i did first impart my love to you i freely told you all the wealth i had ran in my veins i was a gentleman and then i told you true and yet dear lady rating myself at nothing you shall see how much i was a braggart
when i told you my state was nothing i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing for indeed i have engaged myself to a dear friend engaged my friend to his mere enemy to feed my means
here is a letter lady the paper as the body of my friend and every word in it a gaping wound issuing lifeblood
but is it true salerio
have all his ventures faild
what not one hit
from tripolis from mexico and england from lisbon barbary and india
and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch of merchantmarring rocks
not one my lord
besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it
never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond
when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonios flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him and i know my lord if law authority and power deny not it will go hard with poor antonio
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
the dearest friend to me the kindest man the bestconditiond and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears than any that draws breath in italy
what sum owes he the jew
for me three thousand ducats
what no more
pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanios fault
first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portias side with an unquiet soul
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along
my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows
come away
for you shall hence upon your weddingday bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear
but let me hear the letter of your friend
none miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible i should live all debts are cleared between you and i if i might but see you at my death
notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter
o love dispatch all business and be gone
since i have your good leave to go away i will make haste but till i come again no bed shall eer be guilty of my stay no rest be interposer twixt us twain
gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy this is the fool that lent out money gratis gaoler look to him
hear me yet good shylock
ill have my bond speak not against my bond i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
thou calldst me dog before thou hadst a cause but since i am a dog beware my fangs the duke shall grant me justice
i do wonder thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond to come abroad with him at his request
i pray thee hear me speak
ill have my bond i will not hear thee speak ill have my bond and therefore speak no more
ill not be made a soft and dulleyed fool to shake the head relent and sigh and yield to christian intercessors
follow not ill have no speaking i will have my bond
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men
let him alone ill follow him no more with bootless prayers
he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliverd from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold
the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of his state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations
therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor
well gaoler on
pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not
madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord
but if you knew to whom you show this honour how true a gentleman you send relief how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you
i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord
if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowd in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery
this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things
lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lords return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lords return there is a monastery two miles off and there will we abide
i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you
madam with all my heart i shall obey you in all fair commands
my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself
and so farewell till we shall meet again
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
i wish your ladyship all hearts content
i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica
now balthasar as i have ever found thee honesttrue so let me find thee still
take this same letter and use thou all the endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousins hand doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the tranect to the common ferry which trades to venice
waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee
madam i go with all convenient speed
come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of well see our husbands before they think of us
shall they see us
they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack
ill hold thee any wager when we are both accoutred like young men ill prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then ill repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies ill tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth
i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise
why shall we turn to men
fie what a questions that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
but come ill tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today
yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore i promise ye i fear you
i was always plain with you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you are damned
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
and what hope is that i pray thee
marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the jews daughter
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways
i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a christian
truly the more to blame he we were christians enow before een as many as could well live one by another
this making christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
ill tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes
i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners
nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i are out
he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly the moor is with child by you launcelot
it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i took her for
how every fool can play upon the word
i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots
go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
that is done sir they have all stomachs
goodly lord what a witsnapper are you
then bid them prepare dinner
that is done too sir only cover is the word
will you cover then sir
not so sir neither i know my duty
yet more quarrelling with occasion
wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant
i pray tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner
for the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
o dear discretion how his words are suited
the fool hath planted in his memory an army of good words and i do know a many fools that stand in better place garnishd like him that for a tricksy word defy the matter
how cheerest thou jessica
and now good sweet say thy opinion how dost thou like the lord bassanios wife
past all expressing
it is very meet the lord bassanio live an upright life for having such a blessing in his lady he finds the joys of heaven here on earth and if on earth he do not mean it then in reason he should never come to heaven why if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women and portia one there must be something else pawnd with the other for the poor rude world hath not her fellow
even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife
nay but ask my opinion too of that
i will anon first let us go to dinner
nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
no pray thee let it serve for tabletalk  then howsoer thou speakst mong other things i shall digest it
well ill set you forth
what is antonio here
ready so please your grace
i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy
i have heard your grace hath taen great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envys reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his
go one and call the jew into the court
he is ready at the door he comes my lord
make room and let him stand before our face
shylock the world thinks and i think so too that thou but leadst this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act and then tis thought thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty and where thou now exactst the penalty which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture but touchd with human gentleness and love forgive a moiety of the principal glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint from stubborn turks and tartars never traind to offices of tender courtesy
we all expect a gentle answer jew
i have possessd your grace of what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your citys freedom
youll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats ill not answer that but say it is my humour is it answerd
what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned
what are you answerd yet
some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose cannot contain their urine for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes
now for your answer as there is no firm reason to be renderd why he cannot abide a gaping pig why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio that i follow thus a losing suit against him
are you answerd
this is no answer thou unfeeling man to excuse the current of thy cruelty
i am not bound to please thee with my answers
do all men kill the things they do not love
hates any man the thing he would not kill
every offence is not a hate at first
what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften thatthan which whats harder his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will
for thy three thousand ducats here is six
what judgment shall i dread doing were in six parts and every part a ducat i would not draw them i would have my bond
how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
you have among you many a purchased slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them shall i say to you let them be free marry them to your heirs
why sweat they under burthens
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasond with such viands
you will answer the slaves are ours so do i answer you the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it
if you deny me fie upon your law
there is no force in the decrees of venice
i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today
my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from padua
bring us the letter call the messenger
good cheer antonio
what man courage yet
the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph
came you from padua from bellario
from both my lord
bellario greets your grace
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can no not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy
can no prayers pierce thee
no none that thou hast wit enough to make
o be thou damnd inexecrable dog
and for thy life let justice be accused
thou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou layst in thy unhallowd dam infused itself in thee for thy desires are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin
i stand here for law
this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court
where is he
he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether youll admit him
with all my heart
some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place
meantime the court shall hear bellarios letter
none your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar
i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turned oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your graces request in my stead
i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head
i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation
you hear the learnd bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come
give me your hand
come you from old bellario
i did my lord
you are welcome take your place
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court
i am informed thoroughly of the cause
which is the merchant here and which the jew
antonio and old shylock both stand forth
is your name shylock
shylock is my name
of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed
you stand within his danger do you not
ay so he says
do you confess the bond
i do
then must the jew be merciful
on what compulsion must i
tell me that
the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice
therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy
i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
my deeds upon my head
i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond
is he not able to discharge the money
yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times oer on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth
and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will
it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be
a daniel come to judgment
yea a daniel
o wise young judge how i do honour thee
i pray you let me look upon the bond
here tis most reverend doctor here it is
shylock theres thrice thy money offerd thee
an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul
no not for venice
why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchants heart
be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
when it is paid according to the tenor
it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a welldeserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment
why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife
o noble judge
o excellent young man
for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond
tis very true o wise and upright judge
how much more elder art thou than thy looks
therefore lay bare your bosom
ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge
nearest his heart those are the very words
it is so
are there balance here to weigh the flesh
i have them ready
have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
is it so nominated in the bond
it is not so expressd but what of that
twere good you do so much for charity
i cannot find it tis not in the bond
you merchant have you any thing to say
but little i am armd and well prepared
give me your hand bassanio fare you well
grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off
commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonios end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love
repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough ill pay it presently with all my heart
antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteemd above thy life i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you
your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer
i have a wife whom i protest i love i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew
tis well you offer it behind her back the wish would make else an unquiet house
these be the christian husbands
i have a daughter would any of the stock of barrabas had been her husband rather than a christian
we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
a pound of that same merchants flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it
most rightful judge
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it
most learned judge
a sentence
come prepare
tarry a little there is something else
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice
o upright judge
mark jew o learned judge
is that the law
thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
o learned judge
mark jew a learned judge
i take this offer then pay the bond thrice and let the christian go
here is the money
soft
the jew shall have all justice soft
no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty
o jew
an upright judge a learned judge
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou cutst more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
a second daniel a daniel jew
now infidel i have you on the hip
why doth the jew pause
take thy forfeiture
give me my principal and let me go
i have it ready for thee here it is
he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond
a daniel still say i a second daniel
i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shall i not have barely my principal
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew
why then the devil give him good of it
ill stay no longer question
tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you
it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offenders life lies in the mercy of the duke only gainst all other voice
in which predicament i say thou standst for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurrd the danger formerly by me rehearsed
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state thou hast not left the value of a cord therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it for half thy wealth it is antonios the other half comes to the general state which humbleness may drive unto a fine
ay for the state not for antonio
nay take my life and all pardon not that you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live
what mercy can you render him antonio
a halter gratis nothing else for gods sake
so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favour he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessd unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
he shall do this or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here
art thou contented jew
what dost thou say
i am content
clerk draw a deed of gift
i pray you give me leave to go from hence i am not well send the deed after me and i will sign it
get thee gone but do it
in christening shalt thou have two godfathers had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more to bring thee to the gallows not the font
sir i entreat you home with me to dinner
i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not
antonio gratify this gentleman for in my mind you are much bound to him
most worthy gentleman i and my friend have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties in lieu whereof three thousand ducats due unto the jew we freely cope your courteous pains withal
and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore
he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary
i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave
dear sir of force i must attempt you further take some remembrance of us as a tribute not as a fee grant me two things i pray you not to deny me and to pardon me
you press me far and therefore i will yield
give me your gloves ill wear them for your sake and for your love ill take this ring from you do not draw back your hand ill take no more and you in love shall not deny me this
this ring good sir alas it is a trifle
i will not shame myself to give you this
i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it
theres more depends on this than on the value
the dearest ring in venice will i give you and find it out by proclamation only for this i pray you pardon me
i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answerd
good sir this ring was given me by my wife and when she put it on she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it
that scuse serves many men to save their gifts
an if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved the ring she would not hold out enemy for ever for giving it to me
well peace be with you
my lord bassanio let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued against your wifes commandment
go gratiano run and overtake him give him the ring and bring him if thou canst unto antonios house away
make haste
come you and i will thither presently and in the morning early will we both fly toward belmont come antonio
inquire the jews house out give him this deed and let him sign it well away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo
fair sir you are well oertaen my lord bassanio upon more advice hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat your company at dinner
that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylocks house
that will i do
sir i would speak with you
ill see if i can get my husbands ring which i did make him swear to keep for ever
none we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but well outface them and outswear them too
away
make haste thou knowist where i will tarry
come good sir will you show me to this house
the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night
in such a night did thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew and saw the lions shadow ere himself and ran dismayd away
in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage
in such a night medea gatherd the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson
in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont
in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well stealing her soul with many vows of faith and neer a true one
in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her
i would outnight you did no body come but hark i hear the footing of a man
who comes so fast in silence of the night
a friend
a friend
what friend
your name i pray you friend
stephano is my name and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont she doth stray about by holy crosses where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours
who comes with her
none but a holy hermit and her maid
i pray you is my master yet returnd
he is not nor we have not heard from him
but go we in i pray thee jessica and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house
sola sola
wo ha ho
sola sola
who calls
sola
did you see master lorenzo
master lorenzo sola sola
leave hollaing man here
sola
where
where
here
tell him theres a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning
sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming
and yet no matter why should we go in
my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony
sit jessica
look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
come ho
and wake diana with a hymn
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music
i am never merry when i hear sweet music
the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature
the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted
mark the music
that light we see is burning in my hall
how far that little candle throws his beams
so shines a good deed in a naughty world
when the moon shone we did not see the candle
so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king unto the king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters
music
hark
it is your music madam of the house
nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
silence bestows that virtue on it madam
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren
how many things by season seasond are to their right praise and true perfection
peace ho
the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked
that is the voice or i am much deceived of portia
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice
dear lady welcome home
we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words
are they returnd
madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming
go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are no telltales madam fear you not
this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid
we should hold day with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun
let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all
you are welcome home my lord
i thank you madam
give welcome to my friend
this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound
you should in all sense be much bound to him
for as i hear he was much bound for you
no more than i am well acquitted of
sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
none in faith i gave it to the judges clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart
a quarrel ho already
whats the matter
about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutlers poetry upon a knife love me and leave me not
what talk you of the posy or the value
you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave though not for me yet for your vehement oaths you should have been respective and have kept it
gave it a judges clerk
no gods my judge the clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it
he will an if he live to be a man
ay if a woman live to be a man
now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judges clerk a prating boy that beggd it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him
you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wifes first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters
now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an twere to me i should be mad at it
none and swear i lost the ring defending it
my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that beggd it and indeed deserved it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he beggd mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings
what ring gave you my lord
not that i hope which you received of me
if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone
even so void is your false heart of truth
by heaven i will neer come in your bed until i see the ring
nor i in yours till i again see mine
sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when nought would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure
if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring
what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony
nerissa teaches me what to believe ill die fort but some woman had the ring
no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and beggd the ring the which i did deny him and sufferd him to go displeased away even he that did uphold the very life of my dear friend
what should i say sweet lady
i was enforced to send it after him i was beset with shame and courtesy my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it
pardon me good lady for by these blessed candles of the night had you been there i think you would have beggd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
let not that doctor eer come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you ill not deny him any thing i have no not my body nor my husbands bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own ill have that doctor for my bedfellow
and i his clerk therefore be well advised how you do leave me to mine own protection
well do you so let not me take him then for if i do ill mar the young clerks pen
i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
portia forgive me this enforced wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself mark you but that
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and theres an oath of credit
nay but hear me pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee
i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husbands ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly
then you shall be his surety
give him this and bid him keep it better than the other
here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me
and pardon me my gentle gratiano for that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk in lieu of this last night did lie with me
why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
speak not so grossly
you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returnd i have not yet enterd my house
antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbour suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanced on this letter
i am dumb
were you the doctor and i knew you not
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
ay but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man
sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow when i am absent then lie with my wife
sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road
how now lorenzo
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
ay and ill give them him without a fee
there do i give to you and jessica from the rich jew a special deed of gift after his death of all he dies possessd of
fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starved people
it is almost morning and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full
let us go in and charge us there upon intergatories and we will answer all things faithfully
let it be so the first intergatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day but were the day come i should wish it dark that i were couching with the doctors clerk
well while i live ill fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissas ring
tush
never tell me i take it much unkindly that thou iago who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
sblood but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me
thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate
despise me if i do not
three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant offcappd to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffd with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer
and what was he
forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practise is all his soldiership
but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and igod bless the markhis moorships ancient
by heaven i rather would have been his hangman
why theres no remedy tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first
now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor
i would not follow him then
o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followd
you shall mark many a duteous and kneecrooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his masters ass for nought but provender and when hes old cashierd whip me such honest knaves
others there are who trimmd in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself
for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am
what a full fortune does the thicklips owe if he can carryt thus
call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation ont as it may lose some colour
here is her fathers house ill call aloud
do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities
what ho brabantio
signior brabantio ho
awake
what ho brabantio
thieves
thieves
thieves
look to your house your daughter and your bags
thieves
thieves
what is the reason of this terrible summons
what is the matter there
signior is all your family within
are your doors lockd
why wherefore ask you this
zounds sir youre robbd for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is topping your white ewe
arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say
what have you lost your wits
most reverend signior do you know my voice
not i what are you
my name is roderigo
the worser welcome i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee and now in madness being full of supper and distempering draughts upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet
sir sir sir but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee
patience good sir
what tellst thou me of robbing
this is venice my house is not a grange
most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you
zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians youll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse youll have your nephews neigh to you youll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
what profane wretch art thou
i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs
thou art a villain
you area senator
this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo
sir i will answer any thing
but i beseech you ift be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this oddeven and dull watch o the night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke
do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and every where
straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you
strike on the tinder ho
give me a taper
call up all my people
this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already
light i say
light
farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producedas if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some cheque cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stand in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hellpains
yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign
that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raised search and there will i be with him
so farewell
it is too true an evil gone she is and whats to come of my despised time is nought but bitterness
now roderigo where didst thou see her
o unhappy girl
with the moor sayst thou
who would be a father
how didst thou know twas she
o she deceives me past thought
what said she to you
get more tapers raise all my kindred
are they married think you
truly i think they are
o heaven
how got she out
o treason of the blood
fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds by what you see them act
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused
have you not read roderigo of some such thing
yes sir i have indeed
call up my brother
o would you had had her
some one way some another
do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor
i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me
pray you lead on
at every house ill call i may command at most
get weapons ho
and raise some special officers of night
on good roderigo ill deserve your pains
though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerkd him here under the ribs
tis better as it is
nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him
but i pray you sir are you fast married
be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the dukes he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable
let him do his spite my services which i have done the signiory shall outtongue his complaints
tis yet to know which when i know that boasting is an honour i shall promulgatei fetch my life and being from men of royal siege and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reachd for know iago but that i love the gentle desdemona i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the seas worth
but look
what lights come yond
those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in
not i i must be found my parts my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly
is it they
by janus i think no
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant
the goodness of the night upon you friends
what is the news
the duke does greet you general and he requires your hasteposthaste appearance even on the instant
what is the matter think you
something from cyprus as i may divine it is a business of some heat the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one anothers heels and many of the consuls raised and met are at the dukes already you have been hotly calld for when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out
tis well i am found by you
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you
ancient what makes he here
faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack if it prove lawful prize hes made for ever
i do not understand
hes married
to who
marry tocome captain will you go
have with you
here comes another troop to seek for you
it is brabantio
general be advised he comes to bad intent
holla
stand there
signior it is the moor
down with him thief
you roderigo
come sir i am for you
keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
good signior you shall more command with years than with your weapons
o thou foul thief where hast thou stowd my daughter
damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her for ill refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
judge me the world if tis not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion ill havet disputed on tis probable and palpable to thinking
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant
lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril
hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter
where will you that i go to answer this your charge
to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer
what if i do obey
how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him
tis true most worthy signior the dukes in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for
how
the duke in council
in this time of the night
bring him away mines not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
there is no composition in these news that gives them credit
indeed they are disproportiond my letters say a hundred and seven galleys
and mine a hundred and forty
and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus
nay it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense
none a messenger from the galleys
now whats the business
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo
how say you by this change
this cannot be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze
when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dressd in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless
nay in all confidence hes not for rhodes
here is more news
the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet
ay so i thought
how many as you guess
of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus
signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him
tis certain then for cyprus
marcus luccicos is not he in town
hes now in florence
write from us to him postposthaste dispatch
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor
valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman
i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lackd your counsel and your help tonight
so did i yours
good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself
why whats the matter
my daughter
o my daughter
dead
ay to me she is abused stoln from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not
whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action
humbly i thank your grace
here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the stateaffairs hath hither brought
we are very sorry fort
none nothing but this is so
most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approved good masters that i have taen away this old mans daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more
rude am i in my speech and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself
yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnishd tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter
a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushd at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she feard to look on
it is a judgment maimd and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be
i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful oer the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her
to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him
but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maids affections
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth
i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life
fetch desdemona hither
ancient conduct them you best know the place
and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears ill present how i did thrive in this fair ladys love and she in mine
say it othello
her father loved me oft invited me still questiond me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed
i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speaksuch was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders
this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the houseaffairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch sheld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth sufferd
my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd that heaven had made her such a man she thankd me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story
and that would woo her
upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passd and i loved her that she did pity them
this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it
i think this tale would win my daughter too
good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands
i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man
come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience
my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband and so much duty as my mother showd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord
god be wi you
i have done
please it your grace on to the stateaffairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it
come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee
for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them
i have done my lord
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour
when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes
the robbd that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief
so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile
he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus
othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition
the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thricedriven bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites
most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife
due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding
if you please bet at her fathers
ill not have it so
nor i nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye
most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness
what would you desdemona
that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my hearts subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othellos visage in his mind and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence
let me go with him
let her have your voices
vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heatthe young affects in me defunctand proper satisfaction
but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when lightwingd toys of featherd cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation
be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it
you must away tonight
with all my heart
at nine i the morning here well meet again
othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you
so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me
let it be so
good night to every one
and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your soninlaw is far more fair than black
adieu brave moor use desdemona well
look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee
my life upon her faith
honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage
come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time
iago what sayst thou noble heart
what will i do thinkest thou
why go to bed and sleep
i will incontinently drown myself
if thou dost i shall never love thee after
why thou silly gentleman
it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
o villainous
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself
ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i would change my humanity with a baboon
what should i do
i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
virtue
a fig
tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus
our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion
it cannot be
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
come be a man
drown thyself
drown cats and blind puppies
i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now
put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse
it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse
these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida
she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse
if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning
make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money
a pox of drowning thyself
it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her
wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue
thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport
there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered
traverse
go provide thy money
we will have more of this tomorrow
adieu
where shall we meet i the morning
at my lodging
ill be with thee betimes
go to farewell
do you hear roderigo
what say you
no more of drowning do you hear
i am changed ill go sell all my land
thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe
but for my sport and profit
i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not ift be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety
he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him
cassios a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knaveryhow how
lets see after some time to abuse othellos ear that he is too familiar with his wife
he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false
the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are
i havet
it is engenderd
hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light
what from the cape can you discern at sea
nothing at all it is a highwrought flood i cannot twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land a fuller blast neer shook our battlements if it hath ruffiand so upon the sea what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them can hold the mortise
what shall we hear of this
a segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds the windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane seems to cast water on the burning bear and quench the guards of the everfixed pole i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood
if that the turkish fleet be not enshelterd and embayd they are drownd it is impossible they bear it out
news lads
our wars are done
the desperate tempest hath so bangd the turks that their designment halts a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet
how
is this true
the ship is here put in a veronesa michael cassio lieutenant to the warlike moor othello is come on shore the moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus
i am glad ont tis a worthy governor
but this same cassio though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe for they were parted with foul and violent tempest
pray heavens he be for i have served him and the man commands like a full soldier
lets to the seaside ho
as well to see the vessel thats come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard
come lets do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance
thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor
o let the heavens give him defence against the elements for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea
is he well shippd
his bark is stoutly timberd his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure
what noise
the town is empty on the brow o the sea stand ranks of people and they cry a sail
my hopes do shape him for the governor
they do discharge their shot of courtesy our friends at least
i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who tis that is arrived
i shall
but good lieutenant is your general wived
most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener
how now
who has put in
tis one iago ancient to the general
has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the gutterd rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteepd to clog the guiltless keel as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona
what is she
she that i spake of our great captains captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a sennights speed
great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make loves quick pants in desdemonas arms give renewd fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort
o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore
ye men of cyprus let her have your knees
hail to thee lady
and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round
i thank you valiant cassio
what tidings can you tell me of my lord
he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that hes well and will be shortly here
o but i fearhow lost you company
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowshipbut hark
a sail
they give their greeting to the citadel this likewise is a friend
see for the news
good ancient you are welcome
welcome mistress
let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy
sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me youll have enough
alas she has no speech
in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking
you have little cause to say so
come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints m your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
o fie upon thee slanderer
nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work
you shall not write my praise
no let me not
what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me
o gentle lady do not put me tot for i am nothing if not critical
come on assay
theres one gone to the harbour
ay madam
i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise
come how wouldst thou praise me
i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliverd
if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the ones for use the other useth it
well praised
how if she be black and witty
if she be black and thereto have a wit shell find a white that shall her blackness fit
worse and worse
how if fair and foolish
she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helpd her to an heir
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse
what miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolish
theres none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
o heavy ignorance
thou praisest the worst best
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lackd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angerd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cods head for the salmons tail she that could think and neer disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were to do what
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer
o most lame and impotent conclusion
do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband
how say you cassio
is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor
he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar
none whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio
ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship
you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in
very good well kissed
an excellent courtesy
tis so indeed
yet again your fingers to your lips
would they were clysterpipes for your sake
the moor
i know his trumpet
tis truly so
lets meet him and receive him
lo where he comes
o my fair warrior
my dear othello
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me
o my souls joy
if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have wakend death
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympushigh and duck again as low as hells from heaven
if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow
amen to that sweet powers
i cannot speak enough of this content it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be that eer our hearts shall make
none but ill set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am
come let us to the castle
news friends our wars are done the turks are drownd
how does my old acquaintance of this isle
honey you shall be well desired in cyprus i have found great love amongst them
o my sweet i prattle out of fashion and i dote in mine own comforts
i prithee good iago go to the bay and disembark my coffers bring thou the master to the citadel he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect
come desdemona once more well met at cyprus
do thou meet me presently at the harbour
come hither
if thou best valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is directly in love with him
with him
why tis not possible
lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating
let not thy discreet heart think it
her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice
now sir this grantedas it is a most pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does
a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection
why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave
besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already
i cannot believe that in her shes full of most blessed condition
blessed figsend
the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor
blessed pudding
didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
didst not mark that
yes that i did but that was but courtesy
lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together
villanous thoughts roderigo
when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish
but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice
watch you tonight for the command ill layt upon you
cassio knows you not
ill not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister
well
sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity
i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity
i warrant thee
meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore
farewell
adieu
that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think hell prove to desdemona a most dear husband
now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evend with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure
which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on ill have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me
for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness
tis here but yet confused knaverys plain face is never seen tin used
it is othellos pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed
all offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven
heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello
good michael look you to the guard tonight lets teach ourselves that honourable stop not to outsport discretion
iago hath direction what to do but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look tot
iago is most honest
michael good night tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with you
come my dear love the purchase made the fruits are to ensue that profits yet to come tween me and you
good night
welcome iago we must to the watch
not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the clock
our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove
shes a most exquisite lady
and ill warrant her fun of game
indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature
what an eye she has
methinks it sounds a parley of provocation
an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
she is indeed perfection
well happiness to their sheets
come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello
not tonight good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment
o they are our friends but one cup ill drink for you
i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more
what man
tis a night of revels the gallants desire it
where are they
here at the door i pray you call them in
ill dot but it dislikes me
if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already hell be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress dog
now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottledeep and hes to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flusterd with flowing cups and they watch too
now mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the islebut here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream
fore god they have given me a rouse already
good faith a little one not past a pint as i am a soldier
some wine ho
and let me the canakin clink clink and let me the canakin clink a soldiers a man a lifes but a span why then let a soldier drink
some wine boys
fore god an excellent song
i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swagbellied hollanderdrink hoare nothing to your english
is your englishman so expert in his drinking
why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled
to the health of our general
i am for it lieutenant and ill do you justice
o sweet england
king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he calld the tailor lown
he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee
some wine ho
why this is a more exquisite song than the other
will you heart again
no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things
well gods above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
its true good lieutenant
for mine own partno offence to the general nor any man of qualityi hope to be saved
and so do i too lieutenant
ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient
lets have no more of this lets to our affairsforgive us our sinsgentlemen lets look to our business
do not think gentlemen
i am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and speak well enough
excellent well
why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk
to the platform masters come lets set the watch
you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him
i fear the trust othello puts him in
on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island
but is he often thus
tis evermore the prologue to his sleep hell watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle
it were well the general were put in mind of it
perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true
none i pray you after the lieutenant go
and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor
not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evilbut hark
what noise
you rogue
you rascal
whats the matter lieutenant
a knave teach me my duty
ill beat the knave into a twiggen bottle

why how now ho
from whence ariseth this
are we turnd turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites
for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety
what is the matter masters
honest iago that lookst dead with grieving speak who began this
on thy love i charge thee
i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at others breast in opposition bloody
i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it
how comes it michael you are thus forgot
i pray you pardon me i cannot speak
worthy montano you were wont be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure whats the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler
give me answer to it
worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me thats said or done amiss this night unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us
now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way if i once stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke
give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offence though he had twinnd with me both at a birth shall lose me
what
in a town of war yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety
tis monstrous
iago who begant
if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier
touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him
thus it is general
montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him
sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamouras it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returnd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i neer might say before
when i came back for this was briefi found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them
more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass
i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio
cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine
look if my gentle love be not raised up
ill make thee an example
whats the matter
alls well now sweeting come away to bed
sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off
iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
what are you hurt lieutenant
ay past all surgery
marry heaven forbid
reputation reputation reputation
o i have lost my reputation
i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial
my reputation iago my reputation
as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation
reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser
what man
there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer
drunk
and speak parrot
and squabble
swagger
swear
and discourse fustian with ones own shadow
o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil
what was he that you followed with your sword
what had he done to you
i know not
ist possible
i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore
o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains
that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered
it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself
come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard
had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all
to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast
o strange
every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it
and good lieutenant i think you think i love you
i have well approved it sir
i drunk
you or any man living may be drunk
at a time man
ill tell you what you shall do
our generals wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
you advise me well
i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
you are in the right
good night lieutenant i must to the watch
good night honest iago
and whats he then that says i play the villain
when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again
for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit shes framed as fruitful as the free elements
and then for her to win the moorweret to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetterd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function
how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good
divinity of hell
when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor ill pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her bodys lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor
so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all
how now roderigo
i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry
my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice
how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time
doest not go well
cassio hath beaten thee
and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile
by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short
retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone
two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress ill set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay thats the way dull not device by coldness and delay
masters play here i will content your pains something thats brief and bid good morrow general
why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i the nose thus
how sir how
are these i pray you windinstruments
ay marry are they sir
o thereby hangs a tail
whereby hangs a tale sir
marry
sir by many a windinstrument that i know
but masters heres money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for loves sake to make no more noise with it
well sir we will not
if you have any music that may not be heard tot again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care
we have none such sir
then put up your pipes in your bag for ill away go vanish into air away
dost thou hear my honest friend
no i hear not your honest friend i hear you
prithee keep up thy quillets
theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this
she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her
do good my friend
in happy time iago
you have not been abed then
why no the day had broke before we parted
i have made bold iago to send in to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access
ill send her to you presently and ill devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free
i humbly thank you fort
i never knew a florentine more kind and honest
good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well
the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again
yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone
pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely
i am much bound to you
these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me
well my good lord ill dot
this fortification gentlemen shall we seet
well wait upon your lordship
be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf
good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his
o thats an honest fellow
do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were
bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio hes never any thing but your true servant
i knowt i thank you
you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance
ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service
do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship ill perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift ill intermingle every thing he does with cassios suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away
madam here comes my lord
madam ill take my leave
why stay and hear me speak
madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes
well do your discretion
ha
i like not that
what dost thou say
nothing my lord or ifi know not what
was not that cassio parted from my wife
cassio my lord
no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing you coming
i do believe twas he
how now my lord
i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure
who ist you mean
why your lieutenant cassio
good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back
went he hence now
ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him
good love call him back
not now sweet desdemona some other time
but shallt be shortly
the sooner sweet for you
shallt be tonight at supper
no not tonight
tomorrow dinner then
i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel
why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith hes penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their bestis not almost a fault to incur a private cheque
when shall he come
tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on
what
michael cassio that came awooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath taen your part to have so much to do to bring him in
trust me i could do much prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing
why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted
i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself
shall i deny you
no farewell my lord
farewell my desdemona ill come to thee straight
emilia come
be as your fancies teach you whateer you be i am obedient
excellent wretch
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee
and when i love thee not chaos is come again
my noble lord what dost thou say iago
did michael cassio when you wood my lady know of your love
he did from first to last why dost thou ask
but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm
why of thy thought iago
i did not think he had been acquainted with her
o yes and went between us very oft
indeed
indeed
ay indeed discernst thou aught in that
is he not honest
honest my lord
honest
ay honest
my lord for aught i know
what dost thou think
think my lord
think my lord
by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown
thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like
and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed
and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought
my lord you know i love you
i think thou dost and for i know thourt full of love and honesty and weighst thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man thats just they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule
for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest
i think so too
men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none
certain men should be what they seem
why then i think cassios an honest man
nay yet theres more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words
good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to
utter my thoughts
why say they are vile and false as wheres that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not
who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and lawdays and in session sit with meditations lawful
thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts
i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my natures plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance
it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts
what dost thou mean
good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed
by heaven ill know thy thoughts
you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody
ha
o beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he oer who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
o misery
poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor
good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy
why why is this
thinkst thou ild make a lie of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions
no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference
tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me
no iago ill see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy
i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me
i speak not yet of proof
look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of selfbounty be abused look tot i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leavet undone but keept unknown
dost thou say so
she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most
and so she did
why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her fathers eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you
i am bound to thee for ever
i see this hath a little dashd your spirits
not a jot not a jot
i faith i fear it has
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love
but i do see youre moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion
i will not
should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at
cassios my worthy friend my lord i see youre moved
no not much moved i do not think but desdemonas honest
long live she so
and long live you to think so
and yet how nature erring from itself ay theres the point asto be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh
one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent
farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago none why did i marry
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
none your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that
in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour
fear not my government
i once more take my leave
this fellows of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings
if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings ild whistle her off and let her down the wind to pray at fortune
haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of yearsyet thats not much shes gone
i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her
o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites
i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses
yet tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken
desdemona comes if she be false o then heaven mocks itself
ill not believet
how now my dear othello
your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence
i am to blame
why do you speak so faintly
are you not well
i have a pain upon my forehead here
faith thats with watching twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well
your napkin is too little let it alone
come ill go in with you
i am very sorry that you are not well
i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times wood me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to
ill have the work taen out and givet iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy
how now
what do you here alone
do not you chide i have a thing for you
a thing for me
it is a common thing ha
to have a foolish wife
o is that all
what will you give me now for the same handkerchief
what handkerchief
what handkerchief
why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal
hast stoln it from her
no faith she let it drop by negligence
and to the advantage i being here tookt up
look here it is
a good wench give it me
what will you do with t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it
none if it be not for some purpose of import givet me again poor lady shell run mad when she shall lack it
be not acknown on t i have use for it
go leave me
i will in cassios lodging lose this napkin and let him find it
trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something
the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood
burn like the mines of sulphur
i did say so look where he comes
not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday
ha
ha
false to me
why how now general
no more of that
avaunt
be gone
thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abused than but to knowt a little
how now my lord
what sense had i of her stoln hours of lust
i sawt not thought it not it harmd not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassios kisses on her lips he that is robbd not wanting what is stoln let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all
i am sorry to hear this
i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known
o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind
farewell content
farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue
o farewell
farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal joves dead clamours counterfeit farewell
othellos occupations gone
ist possible my lord
villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mans eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath
ist come to this
make me to seet or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
my noble lord if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horrors head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that
o grace
o heaven forgive me
are you a man
have you a soul or sense
god be wi you take mine office
o wretched fool
that livest to make thine honesty a vice
o monstrous world
take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe
i thank you for this profit and from hence ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence
nay stay thou shouldst be honest
i should be wise for honestys a fool and loses that it works for
by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not
ill have some proof
her name that was as fresh as dians visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face
if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams ill not endure it
would i were satisfied
i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you
you would be satisfied
would
nay i will
and may but how
how satisfied my lord
would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her toppd
death and damnation
o
it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own
what then
how then
what shall i say
wheres satisfaction
it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk
but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may havet
give me a living reason shes disloyal
i do not like the office but sith i am enterd in this cause so far prickd tot by foolish honesty and love i will go on
i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep
there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature
and then kiss me hard as if he pluckd up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor
o monstrous
monstrous
nay this was but his dream
but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly
ill tear her all to pieces
nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet
tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand
i gave her such a one twas my first gift
i know not that but such a handkerchief i am sure it was your wifesdid i today see cassio wipe his beard with
if it be that if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs
o that the slave had forty thousand lives
one is too poor too weak for my revenge
now do i see tis true
look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven
tis gone
arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate
swell bosom with thy fraught for tis of aspics tongues
yet be content
o blood blood blood
patience i say your mind perhaps may change
never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up
now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words
do not rise yet
witness you everburning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrongd othellos service
let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever
i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee tot within these three days let me hear thee say that cassios not alive
my friend is dead tis done at your request but let her live
damn her lewd minx
o damn her
come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil
now art thou my lieutenant
i am your own for ever
do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies
i dare not say he lies any where
why man
hes a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing
go to where lodges he
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie
can any thing be made of this
i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat
can you inquire him out and be edified by report
i will catechise the world for him that is make questions and by them answer
seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
to do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it
where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
i know not madam
believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking
is he not jealous
who he
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him
look where he comes
i will not leave him now till cassio be calld to him
how ist with you my lord well my good lady
o hardness to dissemble how do you desdemona
well my good lord
give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for heres a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels
tis a good hand a frank one
you may indeed say so for twas that hand that gave away my heart
a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts
i cannot speak of this
come now your promise
what promise chuck
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief
here my lord
that which i gave you
i have it not about me
not
no indeed my lord
that is a fault
that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made gift of it my fathers eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wive to give it her
i did so and take heed ont make it a darling like your precious eye to loset or givet away were such perdition as nothing else could match
ist possible
tis true theres magic in the web of it a sibyl that had numberd in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewd the work the worms were hallowd that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful conserved of maidens hearts
indeed
ist true
most veritable therefore look tot well
then would to god that i had never seent
ha
wherefore
why do you speak so startingly and rash
ist lost
ist gone
speak is it out o the way
heaven bless us
say you
it is not lost but what an if it were
how
i say it is not lost
fetcht let me seet
why so i can sir but i will not now
this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again
fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
come come youll never meet a more sufficient man
the handkerchief
i pray talk me of cassio
the handkerchief
a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you the handkerchief
in sooth you are to blame
away
is not this man jealous
i neer saw this before
sure theres some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it
tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food to eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us
look you cassio and my husband
there is no other way tis she must dot and lo the happiness
go and importune her
how now good cassio
whats the news with you
madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour i would not be delayd
if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortunes alms
alas thricegentle cassio
my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alterd
so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech
you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you
is my lord angry
he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness
can he be angry
i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffd his own brotherand can he be angry
something of moment then i will go meet him theres matter int indeed if he be angry
i prithee do so
something sure of state either from venice or some unhatchd practise made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases mens natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object
tis even so for let our finger ache and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal
beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had subornd the witness and hes indicted falsely
pray heaven it be statematters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you
alas the day
i never gave him cause
but jealous souls will not be answerd so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster begot upon itself born on itself
heaven keep that monster from othellos mind
lady amen
i will go seek him
cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit ill move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost
i humbly thank your ladyship
save you friend cassio
what make you from home
how is it with you my most fair bianca
i faith sweet love i was coming to your house
and i was going to your lodging cassio
what keep a week away
seven days and nights
eight score eight hours
and lovers absent hours more tedious than the dial eight score times
o weary reckoning
pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been pressd but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence
sweet bianca take me this work out
o cassio whence came this
this is some token from a newer friend to the felt absence now i feel a cause ist come to this
well well
go to woman
throw your vile guesses in the devils teeth from whence you have them
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress some remembrance no in good troth bianca
why whose is it
i know not sweet i found it in my chamber
i like the work well ere it be demanded as like enough it willild have it copied take it and dot and leave me for this time
leave you
wherefore
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition nor my wish to have him see me womand
why i pray you
not that i love you not
but that you do not love me
i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night
tis but a little way that i can bring you for i attend here but ill see you soon
tis very good i must be circumstanced
will you think so
think so iago
what to kiss in private
an unauthorized kiss
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm
naked in bed iago and not mean harm
it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously and yet do so the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
so they do nothing tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief what then
why then tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestowt on any man
she is protectress of her honour too may she give that
her honour is an essence thats not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it
thou saidst it comes oer my memory as doth the raven oer the infected house boding to allhe had my handkerchief
ay what of that
thats not so good now
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong
or heard him sayas knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinced or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab hath he said any thing
he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than hell unswear
what hath he said
faith that he didi know not what he did
what
what
lie with her
with her on her what you will
lie with her
lie on her
we say lie on her when they belie her
lie with her
thats fulsome
handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchiefto confess and be hanged for his labourfirst to be hanged and then to confessi tremble at it
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction
it is not words that shake me thus
pish
noses ears and lips
ist possibleconfesshandkerchiefo devil work on my medicine work
thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach
what ho
my lord
my lord i say
othello
how now cassio
whats the matter
my lord is falln into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday
rub him about the temples
no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness
look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you
how is it general
have you not hurt your head
dost thou mock me
i mock you
no by heaven
would you would bear your fortune like a man
a horned mans a monster and a beast
theres many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster
did he confess it
good sir be a man think every bearded fellow thats but yoked may draw with you theres millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
o tis the spite of hell the fiends archmock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste
no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be
o thou art wise tis certain
stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list
whilst you were here oerwhelmed with your grief a passion most unsuiting such a man cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised
do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture
marry patience or i shall say you are all in all in spleen and nothing of a man
dost thou hear iago
i will be found most cunning in my patience butdost thou hearmost bloody
thats not amiss but yet keep time in all
will you withdraw
now will i question cassio of bianca a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpets plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot refrain from the excess of laughter
here he comes as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassios smiles gestures and light behavior quite in the wrong
how do you now lieutenant
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me
ply desdemona well and you are sure ont
now if this suit lay in biancos power how quickly should you speed
alas poor caitiff
look how he laughs already
i never knew woman love man so
alas poor rogue
i think i faith she loves me
now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
do you hear cassio
now he importunes him to tell it oer go to well said well said
she gives it out that you shall marry hey do you intend it
ha ha ha
do you triumph roman
do you triumph
i marry her
what
a customer
prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
ha ha ha
so so so so they laugh that win
faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
prithee say true
i am a very villain else
have you scored me
well
this is the monkeys own giving out she is persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise
iago beckons me now he begins the story
she was here even now she haunts me in every place
i was the other day talking on the seabank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck crying o dear cassio
as it were his gesture imports it
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me ha ha ha
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber
o i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall throw it to
well i must leave her company
before me
look where she comes
tis such another fitchew
marry a perfumed one
what do you mean by this haunting of me
let the devil and his dam haunt you
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
i was a fine fool to take it
i must take out the worka likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there
this is some minxs token and i must take out the work
there give it your hobbyhorse wheresoever you had it ill take out no work ont
how now my sweet bianca
how now
how now
by heaven that should be my handkerchief
an youll come to supper tonight you may an you will not come when you are next prepared for
after her after her
faith i must shell rail in the street else
will you sup there
faith i intend so
well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you
prithee come will you
go to say no more
none did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
o iago
and did you see the handkerchief
was that mine
yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife
she gave it him and he hath given it his whore
i would have him nine years akilling
a fine woman
a fair woman
a sweet woman
nay you must forget that
ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live no my heart is turned to stone i strike it and it hurts my hand
o the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperors side and command him tasks
nay thats not your way
hang her
i do but say what she is so delicate with her needle an admirable musician o
she will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention shes the worse for all this
o a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition
ay too gentle
nay thats certain but yet the pity of it iago
o iago the pity of it iago
if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody
i will chop her into messes cuckold me
o tis foul in her
with mine officer
thats fouler
get me some poison iago this night ill not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again this night iago
do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated
good good the justice of it pleases very good
and for cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight
excellent good
what trumpet is that same
something from venice sure
tis lodovico come from the duke and see your wife is with him
save you worthy general
with all my heart sir
the duke and senators of venice greet you
i kiss the instrument of their pleasures
and whats the news good cousin lodovico
i am very glad to see you signior welcome to cyprus
i thank you
how does lieutenant cassio
lives sir
cousin theres falln between him and my lord an unkind breach but you shall make all well
are you sure of that
my lord
none he did not call hes busy in the paper
is there division twixt my lord and cassio
a most unhappy one i would do much to atone them for the love i bear to cassio
fire and brimstone
my lord
are you wise
what is he angry
may be the letter moved him for as i think they do command him home deputing cassio in his government
trust me i am glad ont
indeed
my lord
i am glad to see you mad
why sweet othello none i have not deserved this
my lord this would not be believed in venice though i should swear i sawt tis very much make her amends she weeps
o devil devil
if that the earth could teem with womans tears each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
out of my sight
i will not stay to offend you
truly an obedient lady i do beseech your lordship call her back
mistress
my lord
what would you with her sir
who i my lord
ay you did wish that i would make her turn sir she can turn and turn and yet go on and turn again and she can weep sir weep and shes obedient as you say obedient very obedient
proceed you in your tears
concerning this siro  wellpainted passion i am commanded home
get you away ill send for you anon
sir i obey the mandate and will return to venice
hence avaunt
cassio shall have my place
and sir tonight i do entreat that we may sup together you are welcome sir to cyprusgoats and monkeys
is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient
is this the nature whom passion could not shake
whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce
he is much changed
are his wits safe
is he not light of brain
hes that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were
what strike his wife
faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst
is it his use
or did the letters work upon his blood and newcreate this fault
alas alas
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known
you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues
i am sorry that i am deceived in him
you have seen nothing then
nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
yes you have seen cassio and she together
but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them
what did they never whisper
never my lord
nor send you out o the way
never
to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
never my lord
thats strange
i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpents curse
for if she be not honest chaste and true theres no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander
bid her come hither go
she says enough yet shes a simple bawd that cannot say as much
this is a subtle whore a closet lock and key of villanous secrets and yet shell kneel and pray i have seen her dot
my lord what is your will
pray chuck come hither
what is your pleasure
let me see your eyes look in my face
what horrible fancys this
none leave procreants alone and shut the door cough or cry hem if any body come your mystery your mystery nay dispatch
upon my knees what doth your speech import
i understand a fury in your words
but not the words
why what art thou
your wife my lord your true and loyal wife
come swear it damn thyself lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves should fear to seize thee therefore be double damnd swear thou art honest
heaven doth truly know it
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
to whom my lord
with whom
how am i false
o desdemona
away
away
away
alas the heavy day
why do you weep
am i the motive of these tears my lord
if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me if you have lost him why i have lost him too
had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction had they raind all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
steepd me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at
yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnerd up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in
turn thy complexion there patience thou young and roselippd cherubin ay there look grim as hell
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing
o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smellst so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst neer been born
alas what ignorant sin have i committed
was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon
what committed
committed
o thou public commoner
i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds
what committed
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushd within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear it
what committed
impudent strumpet
by heaven you do me wrong
are you not a strumpet
no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none
what not a whore
no as i shall be saved
ist possible
o heaven forgive us
i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello
you mistress that have the office opposite to saint peter and keep the gate of hell
you you ay you
we have done our course theres money for your pains i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
alas what does this gentleman conceive
how do you madam
how do you my good lady
faith half asleep
good madam whats the matter with my lord
with who
why with my lord madam
who is thy lord
he that is yours sweet lady
i have none do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answer have i none but what should go by water
prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither
heres a change indeed
tis meet i should be used so very meet
how have i been behaved that he might stick the smallst opinion on my least misuse
what is your pleasure madam
how ist with you
i cannot tell
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding
whats the matter lady
alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true hearts cannot bear
am i that name iago
what name fair lady
such as she says my lord did say i was
he calld her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callat
why did he so
i do not know i am sure i am none such
do not weep do not weep
alas the day
hath she forsook so many noble matches her father and her country and her friends to be calld whore
would it not make one weep
it is my wretched fortune
beshrew him fort
how comes this trick upon him
nay heaven doth know
i will be hangd if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander ill be hangd else
fie there is no such man it is impossible
if any such there be heaven pardon him
a halter pardon him
and hell gnaw his bones
why should he call her whore
who keeps her company
what place
what time
what form
what likelihood
the moors abused by some most villanous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
o heaven that such companions thouldst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west
speak within door
o fie upon them
some such squire he was that turnd your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor
you are a fool go to
o good iago what shall i do to win my lord again
good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him
here i kneel if eer my will did trespass gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did
and ever willthough he do shake me off to beggarly divorcementlove him dearly comfort forswear me
unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love
i cannot say whore it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the worlds mass of vanity could make me
i pray you be content tis but his humour the business of the state does him offence and he does chide with you
if twere no other tis but so i warrant
hark how these instruments summon to supper
the messengers of venice stay the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well
how now roderigo
i do not find that thou dealest justly with me
what in the contrary
every day thou daffest me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope
i will indeed no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered
will you hear me roderigo
faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together
you charge me most unjustly
with nought but truth
i have wasted myself out of my means
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none
well go to very well
very well
go to
i cannot go to man nor tis not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it
very well
i tell you tis not very well
i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you
you have said now
ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing
why now i see theres mettle in thee and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before
give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair
it hath not appeared
i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment
but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose courage and valour this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life
well what is it
is it within reason and compass
sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othellos place
is that true
why then othello and desdemona return again to venice
o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio
how do you mean removing of him
why by making him uncapable of othellos place knocking out his brains
and that you would have me to do
ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune
if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us
come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him
it is now high suppertime and the night grows to waste about it
i will hear further reason for this
and you shall be satisfied
i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
o pardon me twill do me good to walk
madam good night i humbly thank your ladyship
your honour is most welcome
will you walk sir
odesdemona my lord
get you to bed on the instant i will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
i will my lord
how goes it now
he looks gentler than he did
he says he will return incontinent he hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you
dismiss me
it was his bidding therefore good emilia
give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him
i would you had never seen him
so would not i my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
alls one
good faith how foolish are our minds
if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets
come come you talk
my mother had a maid calld barbara she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing twas but it expressd her fortune and she died singing it that song tonight will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbara
prithee dispatch
shall i go fetch your nightgown
no unpin me here
this lodovico is a proper man
a very handsome man
he speaks well
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip
none sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmurd her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and softend the stones lay by these sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee hell come anon sing all a green willow must be my garland
let nobody blame him his scorn i approve nay thats not nexthark
who ist that knocks
its the wind
none said he then
sing willow willow willow if i court moe women youll couch with moe men
so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch doth that bode weeping
tis neither here nor there
i have heard it said so
o these men these men
dost thou in conscience thinktell me emilia that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind
there be some such no question
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
why would not you
no by this heavenly light
nor i neither by this heavenly light i might dot as well i the dark
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
the worlds a huge thing it is a great price
for a small vice
in troth i think thou wouldst not
in troth i think i should and undot when i had done
marry i would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch
i should venture purgatory fort
beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world
why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right
i do not think there is any such woman
yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for
but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge
let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have
what is it that they do when they change us for others
is it sport
i think it is and doth affection breed it
i think it doth ist frailty that thus errs
it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have
then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so
good night good night heaven me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
here stand behind this bulk straight will he come wear thy good rapier bare and put it home quick quick fear nothing ill be at thy elbow it makes us or it mars us think on that and fix most firm thy resolution
be near at hand i may miscarry int
here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand
i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons tis but a man gone
forth my sword he dies
i have rubbd this young quat almost to the sense and he grows angry
now whether he kill cassio or cassio him or each do kill the other every way makes my gain live roderigo he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobbd from him as gifts to desdemona it must not be if cassio do remain he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly and besides the moor may unfold me to him there stand i in much peril no he must die
but so i hear him coming
i know his gait tis hevillain thou diest
that thrust had been mine enemy indeed but that my coat is better than thou knowst i will make proof of thine
o i am slain

where is this rash and most unfortunate man
thats he that was othello here i am
where is that viper
bring the villain forth
i look down towards his feet but thats a fable
if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee
wrench his sword from him
i bleed sir but not killd
i am not sorry neither ild have thee live for in my sense tis happiness to die
o thou othello thou wert once so good falln in the practise of a damned slave what shall be said to thee
why any thing an honourable murderer if you will for nought i did in hate but all in honour
this wretch hath part confessd his villany did you and he consent in cassios death
ay
dear general i never gave you cause
i do believe it and i ask your pardon
will you i pray demand that demidevil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
demand me nothing what you know you know from this time forth i never will speak word
what not to pray
torments will ope your lips
well thou dost best
sir you shall understand what hath befalln which as i think you know not
here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain roderigo and here another the one of them imports the death of cassio to be undertook by roderigo
o villain
most heathenish and most gross
now heres another discontented paper found in his pocket too and this it seems roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain but that belike iago in the interim came in and satisfied him
o the pernicious caitiff
how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wifes
i found it in my chamber and he himself confessd but even now that there he droppd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire
o fool
fool
fool
there is besides in roderigos letter how he upbraids iago that he made him brave me upon the watch whereon it came that i was cast and even but now he spake after long seeming dead iago hurt him iago set him on
you must forsake this room and go with us your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus
for this slave if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long it shall be his
you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state
come bring him away
soft you a word or two before you go
i have done the state some service and they knowt
no more of that
i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexd in the extreme of one whose hand like the base indian threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drop tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum
set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turband turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him thus
o bloody period
all thats spoke is marrd
i kissd thee ere i killd thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss
this did i fear but thought he had no weapon for he was great of heart
none more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
look on the tragic loading of this bed this is thy work the object poisons sight let it be hid
gratiano keep the house and seize upon the fortunes of the moor for they succeed on you
to you lord governor remains the censure of this hellish villain the time the place the torture o enforce it
myself will straight aboard and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate
two households both alike in dignity in fair verona where we lay our scene from ancient grudge break to new mutiny where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of starcrossd lovers take their life whole misadventured piteous overthrows do with their death bury their parents strife
the fearful passage of their deathmarkd love and the continuance of their parents rage which but their childrens end nought could remove is now the two hours traffic of our stage the which if you with patient ears attend what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
gregory o my word well not carry coals
no for then we should be colliers
i mean an we be in choler well draw
ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar
i strike quickly being moved
but thou art not quickly moved to strike
a dog of the house of montague moves me
to move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand therefore if thou art moved thou runnst away
a dog of that house shall move me to stand i will take the wall of any man or maid of montagues
that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the wall
true and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to the wall therefore i will push montagues men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men
tis all one i will show myself a tyrant when i have fought with the men i will be cruel with the maids and cut off their heads
the heads of the maids
ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense thou wilt
they must take it in sense that feel it
me they shall feel while i am able to stand and tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh
tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor john
draw thy tool
here comes two of the house of the montagues
my naked weapon is out quarrel i will back thee
how
turn thy back and run
fear me not
no marry i fear thee
let us take the law of our sides let them begin
i will frown as i pass by and let them take it as they list
nay as they dare
i will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it
do you bite your thumb at us sir
i do bite my thumb sir
do you bite your thumb at us sir
none ay
no
no sir i do not bite my thumb at you sir but i bite my thumb sir
do you quarrel sir
quarrel sir
no sir
if you do sir i am for you i serve as good a man as you
no better
well sir
say better here comes one of my masters kinsmen
yes better sir
you lie
draw if you be men
gregory remember thy swashing blow
part fools
put up your swords you know not what you do
what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
turn thee benvolio look upon thy death
i do but keep the peace put up thy sword or manage it to part these men with me
what drawn and talk of peace
i hate the word as i hate hell all montagues and thee have at thee coward
clubs bills and partisans
strike
beat them down
down with the capulets
down with the montagues
what noise is this
give me my long sword ho
a crutch a crutch
why call you for a sword
my sword i say
old montague is come and flourishes his blade in spite of me
thou villain capulethold me not let me go
thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
rebellious subjects enemies to peace profaners of this neighbourstained steel will they not hear
what ho
you men you beasts that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins on pain of torture from those bloody hands throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince
three civil brawls bred of an airy word by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets and made veronas ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans in hands as old cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
for this time all the rest depart away you capulet shall go along with me and montague come you this afternoon to know our further pleasure in this case to old freetown our common judgmentplace
once more on pain of death all men depart
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
speak nephew were you by when it began
here were the servants of your adversary and yours close fighting ere i did approach i drew to part them in the instant came the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared which as he breathed defiance to my ears he swung about his head and cut the winds who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more and fought on part and part till the prince came who parted either part
o where is romeo
saw you him today
right glad i am he was not at this fray
madam an hour before the worshippd sun peerd forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the citys side so early walking did i see your son towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i measuring his affections by my own that most are busied when theyre most alone pursued my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove
my noble uncle do you know the cause
i neither know it nor can learn of him
have you importuned him by any means
both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himselfi will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
we would as willingly give cure as know
see where he comes so please you step aside ill know his grievance or be much denied
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift
come madam lets away
goodmorrow cousin
is the day so young
but new struck nine
ay me
sad hours seem long
was that my father that went hence so fast
it was
what sadness lengthens romeos hours
not having that which having makes them short
in love
out of love
out of her favour where i am in love
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will
where shall we dine
o me
what fray was here
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
heres much to do with hate but more with love
why then o brawling love
o loving hate
o any thing of nothing first create
o heavy lightness
serious vanity
misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
this love feel i that feel no love in this
dost thou not laugh
no coz i rather weep
good heart at what
at thy good hearts oppression
why such is loves transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears what is it else
a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz
soft
i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong
tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo hes some other where
tell me in sadness who is that you love
what shall i groan and tell thee
groan
why no
but sadly tell me who
bid a sick man in sadness make his will ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
i aimd so near when i supposed you loved
a right good markman
and shes fair i love
a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
well in that hit you miss shell not be hit with cupids arrow she hath dians wit and in strong proof of chastity well armd from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now
be ruled by me forget to think of her
o teach me how i should forget to think
by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties
tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passd that passing fair
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt
but montague is bound as well as i in penalty alike and tis not hard i think for men so old as we to keep the peace
of honourable reckoning are you both and pity tis you lived at odds so long
but now my lord what say you to my suit
but saying oer what i have said before my child is yet a stranger in the world she hath not seen the change of fourteen years let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
younger than she are happy mothers made
and too soon marrd are those so early made
the earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she she is the hopeful lady of my earth but woo her gentle paris get her heart my will to her consent is but a part an she agree within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice
this night i hold an old accustomd feast whereto i have invited many a guest such as i love and you among the store one more most welcome makes my number more
at my poor house look to behold this night earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light such comfort as do lusty young men feel when wellapparelld april on the heel of limping winter treads even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house hear all all see and like her most whose merit most shall be which on more view of many mine being one may stand in number though in reckoning none come go with me
go sirrah trudge about through fair verona find those persons out whose names are written there and to them say my house and welcome on their pleasure stay
find them out whose names are written here
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ
i must to the learnedin good time
tut man one fire burns out anothers burning one pain is lessend by anothers anguish turn giddy and be holp by backward turning one desperate grief cures with anothers languish take thou some new infection to thy eye and the rank poison of the old will die
your plaintainleaf is excellent for that
for what i pray thee
for your broken shin
why romeo art thou mad
not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whippd and tormented andgodden good fellow
god gi godden
i pray sir can you read
ay mine own fortune in my misery
perhaps you have learned it without book but i pray can you read any thing you see
ay if i know the letters and the language
ye say honestly rest you merry
stay fellow i can read
signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of vitravio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena

rest you merry
at this same ancient feast of capulets sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest with all the admired beauties of verona go thither and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show and i will make thee think thy swan a crow
when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires and these who often drownd could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars
one fairer than my love
the allseeing sun neer saw her match since first the world begun
tut you saw her fair none else being by herself poised with herself in either eye but in that crystal scales let there be weighd your ladys love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast and she shall scant show well that now shows best
ill go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendor of mine own

this night you shall behold him at our feast read oer the volume of young paris face and find delight writ there with beautys pen examine every married lineament and see how one another lends content and what obscured in this fair volume lies find written in the margent of his eyes
this precious book of love this unbound lover to beautify him only lacks a cover the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide that book in manys eyes doth share the glory that in gold clasps locks in the golden story so shall you share all that he doth possess by having him making yourself no less
no less
nay bigger women grow by men
speak briefly can you like of paris love
ill look to like if looking liking move but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly
madam the guests are come supper served up you called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and every thing in extremity
i must hence to wait i beseech you follow straight
we follow thee
juliet the county stays
go girl seek happy nights to happy days
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without a apology
the date is out of such prolixity well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf bearing a tartars painted bow of lath scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke after the prompter for our entrance but let them measure us by what they will well measure them a measure and be gone
give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe under loves heavy burden do i sink
and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing
is love a tender thing
it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in a visor for a visor
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
come knock and enter and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs
a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase ill be a candleholder and look on
the game was neer so fair and i am done
tut duns the mouse the constables own word if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst up to the ears
come we burn daylight ho
nay thats not so
i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits
and we mean well in going to this mask but tis no wit to go
why may one ask
i dreamd a dream tonight
and so did i well what was yours
that dreamers often lie
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spiders web the collars of the moonshines watery beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths fivefathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again
this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she peace peace mercutio peace
thou talkst of nothing
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dewdropping south
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late
i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail
on lusty gentlemen
strike drum
wheres potpan that he helps not to take away
he shift a trencher
he scrape a trencher
when good manners shall lie all in one or two mens hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing
away with the jointstools remove the courtcupboard look to the plate
good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell
antony and potpan
ay boy ready
you are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber
we cannot be here and there too
cheerly boys be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all

none enrich the hand of yonder knight
i know not sir
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiopes ear beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady oer her fellows shows
the measure done ill watch her place of stand and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now
forswear it sight
for i neer saw true beauty till this night
this by his voice should be a montague

why how now kinsman
wherefore storm you so
uncle this is a montague our foe a villain that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night
young romeo is it
tis he that villain romeo
content thee gentle coz let him alone he bears him like a portly gentleman and to say truth verona brags of him to be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement therefore be patient take no note of him it is my will the which if thou respect show a fair presence and put off these frowns and illbeseeming semblance for a feast

i will withdraw but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
none this holy shrine the gentle fine is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
then move not while my prayers effect i take
thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from thy lips
o trespass sweetly urged
give me my sin again

ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late ill to my rest

the son and heir of old tiberio
whats he that now is going out of door
marry that i think be young petrucio
whats he that follows there that would not dance
i know not
go ask his name if he be married
my grave is like to be my wedding bed
his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy
my only love sprung from my only hate
too early seen unknown and known too late
prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy
whats this
whats this
a rhyme i learnd even now of one i danced withal
anon anon
come lets away the strangers all are gone
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie and young affection gapes to be his heir that fair for which love groand for and would die with tender juliet matchd is now not fair
now romeo is beloved and loves again alike betwitched by the charm of looks but to his foe supposed he must complain and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her newbeloved any where but passion lends them power time means to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweet
can i go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
romeo
my cousin romeo
he is wise and on my lie hath stoln him home to bed
he ran this way and leapd this orchard wall call good mercutio
nay ill conjure too
romeo
humours
madman
passion
lover
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied cry but ay me
pronounce but love and dove speak to my gossip venus one fair word one nickname for her purblind son and heir young adam cupid he that shot so trim when king cophetua loved the beggarmaid
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not the ape is dead and i must conjure him
i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh and the demesnes that there adjacent lie that in thy likeness thou appear to us
and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
this cannot anger him twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress circle of some strange nature letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjured it down that were some spite my invocation is fair and honest and in his mistress name i conjure only but to raise up him
come he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night blind is his love and best befits the dark
if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
romeo that she were o that she were an open et caetera thou a poperin pear
romeo good night ill to my trucklebed this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep come shall we go
go then for tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found
he jests at scars that never felt a wound
but soft
what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off
it is my lady o it is my love
o that she knew she were
she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
her eye discourses i will answer it
i am too bold tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek
ay me
she speaks o speak again bright angel
for thou art as glorious to this night being oer my head as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air
o romeo romeo
wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a capulet
none tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague
whats montague
it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man
o be some other name
whats in a name
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo calld retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title
romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself
i take thee at thy word call me but love and ill be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo
what man art thou that thus bescreend in night so stumblest on my counsel
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word
my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongues utterance yet i know the sound art thou not romeo and a montague
neither fair saint if either thee dislike
how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here
with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
if they do see thee they will murder thee
alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity
i would not for the world they saw thee here
i have nights cloak to hide me from their sight and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love
by whose direction foundst thou out this place
by love who first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washd with the farthest sea i would adventure for such merchandise
thou knowst the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment
dost thou love me
i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries then say jove laughs
o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my havior light but trust me gentleman ill prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess but that thou overheardst ere i was ware my true loves passion therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruittree tops o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable
what shall i swear by
do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and ill believe thee
if my hearts dear love well do not swear although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens
sweet good night
this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
good night good night
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it and yet i would it were to give again
wouldst thou withdraw it
for what purpose love
but to be frank and give it thee again
and yet i wish but for the thing i have my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite
i hear some noise within dear love adieu
anon good nurse
sweet montague be true
stay but a little i will come again
o blessed blessed night
i am afeard
being in night all this is but a dream too flatteringsweet to be substantial
three words dear romeo and good night indeed
if that thy bent of love be honourable thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow by one that ill procure to come to thee where and what time thou wilt perform the rite and all my fortunes at thy foot ill lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world
none i come anonbut if thou meanst not well i do beseech thee none by and by i come to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief tomorrow will i send
so thrive my soul a thousand times good night
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks
hist
romeo hist
o for a falconers voice to lure this tasselgentle back again
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud else would i tear the cave where echo lies and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeos name
it is my soul that calls upon my name how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night like softest music to attending ears
romeo
my dear
at what oclock tomorrow shall i send to thee
at the hour of nine
i will not fail tis twenty years till then
i have forgot why i did call thee back
let me stand here till thou remember it
i shall forget to have thee still stand there remembering how i love thy company
and ill still stay to have thee still forget forgetting any other home but this
tis almost morning i would have thee gone and yet no further than a wantons bird who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty
i would i were thy bird
sweet so would i yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
good night good night
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
hence will i to my ghostly fathers cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth days path and titans fiery wheels now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
the earth thats natures mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs plants stones and their true qualities for nought so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but straind from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by action dignified
within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant
good morrow father
benedicite
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distemperd head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed care keeps his watch in every old mans eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by some distemperature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
god pardon sin
wast thou with rosaline
with rosaline my ghostly father
no i have forgot that name and that names woe
thats my good son but where hast thou been then
ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me thats by me wounded both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies i bear no hatred blessed man for lo my intercession likewise steads my foe
be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet as mine on hers so hers is set on mine and all combined save what thou must combine by holy marriage when and where and how we met we wood and made exchange of vow ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today
holy saint francis what a change is here
is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken
young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washd off yet if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline and art thou changed
pronounce this sentence then women may fall when theres no strength in men
thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline
for doting not for loving pupil mine
and badst me bury love
not in a grave to lay one in another out to have
i pray thee chide not she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so
o she knew well thy love did read by rote and could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me in one respect ill thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households rancour to pure love
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
where the devil should this romeo be
came he not home tonight
not to his fathers i spoke with his man
ah that same pale hardhearted wench that rosaline
torments him so that he will sure run mad
tybalt the kinsman of old capulet hath sent a letter to his fathers house
a challenge on my life
romeo will answer it
any man that can write may answer a letter
nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared
alas poor romeo
he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft and is he a man to encounter tybalt
why what is tybalt
more than prince of cats i can tell you
o he is the courageous captain of compliments
he fights as you sing pricksong keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause ah the immortal passado
the punto reverso
the hai
the what
the pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes these new tuners of accents
by jesu a very good blade
a very tall man
a very good whore
why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashionmongers these perdonamis who stand so much on the new form that they cannot at ease on the old bench
o their bones their bones
here comes romeo here comes romeo
without his roe like a dried herring flesh flesh how art thou fishified
now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in laura to his lady was but a kitchenwench marry she had a better love to berhyme her dido a dowdy cleopatra a gipsy helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose
signior romeo bon jour
theres a french salutation to your french slop
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
good morrow to you both
what counterfeit did i give you
the ship sir the slip can you not conceive
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
thats as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams
meaning to courtsy
thou hast most kindly hit it
a most courteous exposition
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
pink for flower
right
why then is my pump well flowered
well said follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
o singlesoled jest solely singular for the singleness
come between us good benvolio my wits faint
switch and spurs switch and spurs or ill cry a match
nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five was i with you there for the goose
thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest
nay good goose bite not
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce
and is it not well served in to a sweet goose
o heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad
i stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
why is not this better now than groaning for love
now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
stop there stop there
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
o thou art deceived i would have made it short for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
heres goodly gear
a sail a sail
two two a shirt and a smock

had she affections and warm youthful blood she would be as swift in motion as a ball my words would bandy her to my sweet love and his to me but old folks many feign as they were dead unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
o god she comes
o honey nurse what news
hast thou met with him
send thy man away
peter stay at the gate
now good sweet nurseo lord why lookst thou sad
though news be sad yet tell them merrily if good thou shamest the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face
i am aweary give me leave awhile fie how my bones ache
what a jaunt have i had
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak
jesu what haste
can you not stay awhile
do you not see that i am out of breath
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
is thy news good or bad
answer to that say either and ill stay the circumstance let me be satisfied ist good or bad
well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man romeo
no not he though his face be better than any mans yet his leg excels all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare he is not the flower of courtesy but ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb
go thy ways wench serve god
what have you dined at home
no no but all this did i know before
what says he of our marriage
what of that
lord how my head aches
what a head have i
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
my back o t other sideo my back my back
beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jaunting up and down
i faith i am sorry that thou art not well
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuouswhere is your mother
where is my mother
why she is within where should she be
how oddly thou repliest
your love says like an honest gentleman where is your mother
o gods lady dear

marry come up i trow is this the poultice for my aching bones
henceforward do your messages yourself
heres such a coil
come what says romeo
have you got leave to go to shrift today
i have
then hie you hence to friar laurence cell there stays a husband to make you a wife now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks theyll be in scarlet straight at any news
hie you to church i must another way to fetch a ladder by the which your love must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark i am the drudge and toil in your delight but you shall bear the burden soon at night
go ill to dinner hie you to the cell
hie to high fortune
honest nurse farewell
so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after hours with sorrow chide us not
amen amen
but come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight do thou but close our hands with holy words then lovedevouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
here comes the lady o so light a foot will neer wear out the everlasting flint a lover may bestride the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity
good even to my ghostly confessor
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
as much to him else is his thanks too much
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air and let rich musics tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter
conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
come come with me and we will make short work for by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one
i pray thee good mercutio lets retire the day is hot the capulets abroad and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says god send me no need of thee
and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need
am i like such a fellow
come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved
and what to
nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other
thou
why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter
with another for tying his new shoes with old riband
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the feesimple of my life for an hour and a quarter
the feesimple
o simple
by my head here come the capulets
by my heel i care not
follow me close for i will speak to them
gentlemen good den a word with one of you
and but one word with one of us
couple it with something make it a word and a blow
you shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion
could you not take some occasion without giving
mercutio thou consortst with romeo consort
what dost thou make us minstrels
an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords heres my fiddlestick heres that shall make you dance
zounds consort
we talk here in the public haunt of men either withdraw unto some private place and reason coldly of your grievances or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze i will not budge for no mans pleasure i well peace be with you sir here comes my man
but ill be hanged sir if he wear your livery marry go before to field hell be your follower your worship in that sense may call him man
romeo the hate i bear thee can afford no better term than thisthou art a villain
tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting villain am i none therefore farewell i see thou knowst me not
boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
i do protest i never injured thee but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love and so good capuletwhich name i tender as dearly as my ownbe satisfied
o calm dishonourable vile submission
alla stoccata carries it away
tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
what wouldst thou have with me
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that i mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the eight
will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears
make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out
i am for you
gentle mercutio put thy rapier up
come sir your passado
draw benvolio beat down their weapons
gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage
tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath forbidden bandying in verona streets hold tybalt
good mercutio
i am hurt
a plague o both your houses
i am sped
is he gone and hath nothing
what art thou hurt
ay ay a scratch a scratch marry tis enough
where is my page
go villain fetch a surgeon
courage man the hurt cannot be much
no tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a churchdoor but tis enoughtwill serve ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
i am peppered i warrant for this world
a plague o both your houses
zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death
a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic
why the devil came you between us
i was hurt under your arm
i thought all for the best
help me into some house benvolio or i shall faint
a plague o both your houses
they have made worms meat of me i have it and soundly too your houses
this gentleman the princes near ally my very friend hath got his mortal hurt in my behalf my reputation staind with tybalts slandertybalt that an hour hath been my kinsman
o sweet juliet thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper softend valours steel
o romeo romeo brave mercutios dead
that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds which too untimely here did scorn the earth
this days black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end
here comes the furious tybalt back again
alive in triumph
and mercutio slain
away to heaven respective lenity and fireeyed fury be my conduct now
now tybalt take the villain back again that late thou gavest me for mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company either thou or i or both must go with him
thou wretched boy that didst consort him here shalt with him hence
this shall determine that
romeo away be gone
the citizens are up and tybalt slain
stand not amazed the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken hence be gone away
o i am fortunes fool
why dost thou stay
which way ran he that killd mercutio
tybalt that murderer which way ran he
there lies that tybalt
up sir go with me i charge thee in the princes name obey
where are the vile beginners of this fray
o noble prince i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl there lies the man slain by young romeo that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
tybalt my cousin
o my brothers child
o prince
o cousin
husband
o the blood is spilt o my dear kinsman
prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague
o cousin cousin
benvolio who began this bloody fray
tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did slay romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends
friends part
and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertaind revenge and to t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let benvolio die
he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life
i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
not romeo prince he was mercutios friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt
and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hates proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding but ill amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses therefore use none let romeo hence in haste else when hes found that hour is his last
bear hence this body and attend our will mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds towards phoebus lodging such a wagoner as phaethon would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately
spread thy close curtain loveperforming night that runaways eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees with night
come civil night thou sobersuited matron all in black and learn me how to lose a winning match playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold think true love acted simple modesty
come night come romeo come thou day in night for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a ravens back
come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night give me my romeo and when he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun
o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possessd it and though i am sold not yet enjoyd so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them
o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence
now nurse what news
what hast thou there
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch
ay ay the cords
ay me
what news
why dost thou wring thy hands
ah welladay
hes dead hes dead hes dead
we are undone lady we are undone
alack the day
hes gone hes killd hes dead
can heaven be so envious
romeo can though heaven cannot o romeo romeo
who ever would have thought it
romeo
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
this torture should be roard in dismal hell
hath romeo slain himself
say thou but i and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice i am not i if there be such an i or those eyes shut that make thee answer i
if he be slain say i or if not no brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes god save the markhere on his manly breast a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood all in goreblood i swounded at the sight
o break my heart
poor bankrupt break at once
to prison eyes neer look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
o courteous tybalt
honest gentleman
that ever i should live to see thee dead
what storm is this that blows so contrary
is romeo slaughterd and is tybalt dead
my dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
for who is living if those two are gone
tybalt is gone and romeo banished romeo that killd him he is banished
o god
did romeos hand shed tybalts blood
it did it did alas the day it did
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant
fiend angelical
dovefeatherd raven
wolvishravening lamb
despised substance of divinest show
just opposite to what thou justly seemst a damned saint an honourable villain
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound
o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace
theres no trust no faith no honesty in men all perjured all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
ah wheres my man
give me some aqua vitae these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
shame come to romeo
blisterd be thy tongue for such a wish
he was not born to shame upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit for tis a throne where honour may be crownd sole monarch of the universal earth
o what a beast was i to chide at him
will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have killd my husband back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy
my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalts dead that would have slain my husband all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalts death that murderd me i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds tybalt is dead and romeobanished that banished that one word banished hath slain ten thousand tybalts
tybalts death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rankd with other griefs why followd not when she said tybalts dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentations might have moved
but with a rearward following tybalts death romeo is banished to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead
romeo is banished
there is no end no limit measure bound in that words death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse
weeping and wailing over tybalts corse will you go to them
i will bring you thither
wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent when theirs are dry for romeos banishment
take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled both you and i for romeo is exiled he made you for a highway to my bed but i a maid die maidenwidowed
come cords come nurse ill to my weddingbed and death not romeo take my maidenhead
hie to your chamber ill find romeo to comfort you i wot well where he is
hark ye your romeo will be here at night ill to him he is hid at laurence cell
o find him
give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell
romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man affliction is enamourd of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity
father what news
what is the princes doom
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company i bring thee tidings of the princes doom
what less than doomsday is the princes doom
a gentler judgment vanishd from his lips not bodys death but bodys banishment
ha banishment
be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death do not say banishment
hence from verona art thou banished be patient for the world is broad and wide
there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself
hencebanished is banishd from the world and worlds exile is death then banished is death mistermd calling death banishment thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
o deadly sin
o rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath rushd aside the law and turnd that black word death to banishment this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
tis torture and not mercy heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not more validity more honourable state more courtship lives in carrionflies than romeo they my seize on the white wonder of dear juliets hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin but romeo may not he is banished flies may do this but i from this must fly they are free men but i am banished
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife no sudden mean of death though neer so mean but banished to kill mebanished
o friar the damned use that word in hell howlings attend it how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sinabsolver and my friend professd to mangle me with that word banished
thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
o thou wilt speak again of banishment
ill give thee armour to keep off that word adversitys sweet milk philosophy to comfort thee though thou art banished
yet banished
hang up philosophy
unless philosophy can make a juliet displant a town reverse a princes doom it helps not it prevails not talk no more
o then i see that madmen have no ears
how should they when that wise men have no eyes
let me dispute with thee of thy estate
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel wert thou as young as i juliet thy love an hour but married tybalt murdered doting like me and like me banished then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as i do now taking the measure of an unmade grave
arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself
not i unless the breath of heartsick groans mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
hark how they knock
whos there
romeo arise thou wilt be taken
stay awhile
stand up run to my study
by and by
gods will what simpleness is this
i come i come
who knocks so hard
whence come you
whats your will
none my errand i come from lady juliet
welcome then
o holy friar o tell me holy friar where is my ladys lord wheres romeo
there on the ground with his own tears made drunk
o he is even in my mistress case just in her case
o woful sympathy
piteous predicament
even so lies she blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
stand up stand up stand and you be a man for juliets sake for her sake rise and stand why should you fall into so deep an o
nurse
ah sir
ah sir
well deaths the end of all
spakest thou of juliet
how is it with her
doth she not think me an old murderer now i have staind the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own
where is she
and how doth she
and what says my conceald lady to our cancelld love
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and now falls on her bed and then starts up and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries and then down falls again
as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that names cursed hand murderd her kinsman
o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge
tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion
hold thy desperate hand art thou a man
thy form cries out thou art thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast unseemly woman in a seeming man
or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
thou hast amazed me by my holy order i thought thy disposition better temperd
hast thou slain tybalt
wilt thou slay thyself
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee by doing damned hate upon thyself
why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer aboundst in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skitless soldiers flask is set afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismemberd with thine own defence
what rouse thee man
thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee but thou slewst tybalt there are thou happy too the law that threatend death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misbehaved and sullen wench thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation

farewell my lord
light to my chamber ho
afore me
it is so very very late that we may call it early by and by
good night
wilt thou be gone
it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree believe me love it was the nightingale
it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east nights candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die
yon light is not daylight i know it i it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone
let me be taen let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so
ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye tis but the pale reflex of cynthias brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome
juliet wills it so
how ist my soul
lets talk it is not day
it is it is hie hence be gone away
it is the lark that sings so out of tune straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes o now i would they had changed voices too
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day o now be gone more light and light it grows
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
madam
nurse
your lady mother is coming to your chamber the day is broke be wary look about
then window let day in and let life out
farewell farewell
one kiss and ill descend
art thou gone so
love lord ay husband friend
i must hear from thee every day in the hour for in a minute there are many days o by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo
farewell
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee
o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come
o god i have an illdivining soul
methinks i see thee now thou art below as one dead in the bottom of a tomb either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale
and trust me love in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood
adieu adieu
o fortune fortune
all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle what dost thou with him
that is renownd for faith
be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back
none who ist that calls
is it my lady mother
is she not down so late or up so early
what unaccustomd cause procures her hither
why how now juliet
madam i am not well
evermore weeping for your cousins death
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live therefore have done some grief shows much of love but much of grief shows still some want of wit
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
so shall you feel the loss but not the friend which you weep for
feeling so the loss cannot choose but ever weep the friend
well girl thou weepst not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughterd him
what villain madam
that same villain romeo
none god pardon him
i do with all my heart and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
that is because the traitor murderer lives
ay madam from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousins death
we will have vengeance for it fear thou not then weep no more
ill send to one in mantua where that same banishd runagate doth live shall give him such an unaccustomd dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold himdead is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd
madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet
o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughterd him
find thou the means and ill find such a man
but now ill tell thee joyful tidings girl
and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they i beseech your ladyship
well well thou hast a careful father child one who to put thee from thy heaviness hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expectst not nor i lookd not for
madam in happy time what day is that
marry my child early next thursday morn the gallant young and noble gentleman the county paris at saint peters church shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
now by saint peters church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride
i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo
i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris
these are news indeed
here comes your father tell him so yourself and see how he will take it at your hands
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew but for the sunset of my brothers son it rains downright
how now
a conduit girl
what still in tears
evermore showering
in one little body thou counterfeitst a bark a sea a wind for still thy eyes which i may call the sea do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs who raging with thy tears and they with them without a sudden calm will overset thy tempesttossed body
how now wife
have you deliverd to her our decree
ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
i would the fool were married to her grave
soft
take me with you take me with you wife
how
will she none
doth she not give us thanks
is she not proud
doth she not count her blest unworthy as she is that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
not proud you have but thankful that you have proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love
how now how now choplogic

wife we scarce thought us blest that god had lent us but this only child but now i see this one is one too much and that we have a curse in having her out on her hilding
god in heaven bless her

and why my lady wisdom
hold your tongue good prudence smatter with your gossips go
i speak no treason
o god ye godden

it makes me mad day night hour tide time work play alone in company still my care hath been to have her matchd and having now provided a gentleman of noble parentage of fair demesnes youthful and nobly traind stuffd as they say with honourable parts proportiond as ones thought would wish a man and then to have a wretched puling fool a whining mammet in her fortunes tender to answer ill not wed i cannot love i am too young i pray you pardon me
but as you will not wed ill pardon you graze where you will you shall not house with me look tot think ont i do not use to jest
thursday is near lay hand on heart advise an you be mine ill give you to my friend and you be not hang beg starve die in the streets for by my soul ill neer acknowledge thee nor what is mine shall never do thee good trust tot bethink you ill not be forsworn
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief
o sweet my mother cast me not away
delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies
talk not to me for ill not speak a word do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
o godo nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth
comfort me counsel me
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself
what sayst thou
hast thou not a word of joy
some comfort nurse
faith here it is
romeo is banishd and all the world to nothing that he dares neer come back to challenge you or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth i think it best you married with the county
o hes a lovely gentleman
romeos a dishclout to him an eagle madam hath not so green so quick so fair an eye as paris hath
beshrew my very heart i think you are happy in this second match for it excels your first or if it did not your first is dead or twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him
speakest thou from thy heart
and from my soul too or else beshrew them both
amen
what
well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to laurence cell to make confession and to be absolved
marry i will and this is wisely done
ancient damnation
o most wicked fiend
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times
go counsellor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
ill to the friar to know his remedy if all else fail myself have power to die
on thursday sir
the time is very short
my father capulet will have it so and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
you say you do not know the ladys mind uneven is the course i like it not
immoderately she weeps for tybalts death and therefore have i little talkd of love for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears which too much minded by herself alone may be put from her by society now do you know the reason of this haste
none look sir here comes the lady towards my cell
happily met my lady and my wife
that may be sir when i may be a wife
that may be must be love on thursday next
what must be shall be
thats a certain text
come you to make confession to this father
to answer that i should confess to you
do not deny to him that you love me
i will confess to you that i love him
so will ye i am sure that you love me
if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face
poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite
thou wrongst it more than tears with that report
that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face
thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it
it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone
god shield i should disturb devotion
juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
o shut the door
and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past cure past help
ah juliet i already know thy grief it strains me past the compass of my wits i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it on thursday next be married to this county
tell me not friar that thou hearst of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife ill help it presently
god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo seald shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy longexperienced time give me some present counsel or behold twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speakst speak not of remedy
hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that copest with death himself to scape from it and if thou darest ill give thee remedy
o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a newmade grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
hold then go home be merry give consent to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it
give me give me
o tell not me of fear
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve ill send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord
love give me strength
and strength shall help afford
farewell dear father
so many guests invite as here are writ
sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks
you shall have none ill sir for ill try if they can lick their fingers
how canst thou try them so
marry sir tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me
go be gone
we shall be much unfurnished for this time
what is my daughter gone to friar laurence
ay forsooth
well he may chance to do some good on her a peevish selfwilld harlotry it is
see where she comes from shrift with merry look
how now my headstrong
where have you been gadding
where i have learnd me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoind by holy laurence to fall prostrate here and beg your pardon pardon i beseech you
henceforward i am ever ruled by you
send for the county go tell him of this ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
i met the youthful lord at laurence cell and gave him what becomed love i might not step oer the bounds of modesty
why i am glad ont this is well stand up this is ast should be
let me see the county ay marry go i say and fetch him hither
now afore god
this reverend holy friar our whole city is much bound to him
nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow
no not till thursday there is time enough
go nurse go with her well to church tomorrow
we shall be short in our provision tis now near night
tush i will stir about and all things shall be well i warrant thee wife go thou to juliet help to deck up her ill not to bed tonight let me alone ill play the housewife for this once
what ho
they are all forth
well i will walk myself to county paris to prepare him up against tomorrow my heart is wondrous light since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd
ay those attires are best but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin
what are you busy ho
need you my help
no madam we have culld such necessaries as are behoveful for our state tomorrow so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business
good night get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
farewell
god knows when we shall meet again
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life ill call them back again to comfort me nurse
what should she do here
my dismal scene i needs must act alone
come vial
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall i be married then tomorrow morning
no no this shall forbid it lie thou there
what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministerd to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd because he married me before to romeo
i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man
how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me
theres a fearful point
shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for these many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies festering in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears
and madly play with my forefathers joints
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone as with a club dash out my desperate brains
o look
methinks i see my cousins ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapiers point stay tybalt stay
romeo i come
this do i drink to thee
hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry

dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse and as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church for though fond nature bids us an lament yet natures tears are reasons merriment
all things that we ordained festival turn from their office to black funeral our instruments to melancholy bells our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse and all things change them to the contrary
sir go you in and madam go with him and go sir paris every one prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave the heavens do lour upon you for some ill move them no more by crossing their high will

hang him jack
come well in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustomd spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor
ah me
how sweet is love itself possessd when but loves shadows are so rich in joy
news from veronahow now balthasar
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
how doth my lady
is my father well
how fares my juliet
that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well
then she is well and nothing can be ill her body sleeps in capels monument and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindreds vault and presently took post to tell it you o pardon me for bringing these ill news since you did leave it for my office sir
is it even so
then i defy you stars
thou knowst my lodging get me ink and paper and hire posthorses i will hence tonight
i do beseech you sir have patience your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure
tush thou art deceived leave me and do the thing i bid thee do
hast thou no letters to me from the friar
no my good lord
no matter get thee gone and hire those horses ill be with thee straight
well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
lets see for means o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
i do remember an apothecary and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted in tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meagre were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffd and other skins of illshaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scatterd to make up a show
noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggars shop is shut
what ho
apothecary
who calls so loud
come hither man
i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the lifeweary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb
such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law is death to any he that utters them
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearst to die
famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thine eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this
my poverty but not my will consents
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls doing more murders in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
come cordial and not poison go with me to juliets grave for there must i use thee
holy franciscan friar
brother ho
this same should be the voice of friar john
welcome from mantua what says romeo
or if his mind be writ give me his letter
going to find a barefoot brother out one of our order to associate me here in this city visiting the sick and finding him the searchers of the town suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign seald up the doors and would not let us forth so that my speed to mantua there was stayd
who bare my letter then to romeo
i could not send ithere it is again nor get a messenger to bring it thee so fearful were they of infection
unhappy fortune
by my brotherhood the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import and the neglecting it may do much danger
friar john go hence get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell
brother ill go and bring it thee
now must i to the monument alone within three hours will fair juliet wake she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents but i will write again to mantua and keep her at my cell till romeo come poor living corse closed in a dead mans tomb
give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof yet put it out for i would not be seen
under yond yewtrees lay thee all along holding thine ear close to the hollow ground so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread being loose unfirm with digging up of graves but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me as signal that thou hearst something approach
give me those flowers
do as i bid thee go
none here in the churchyard yet i will adventure
sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew o woe
thy canopy is dust and stones which with sweet water nightly i will dew or wanting that with tears distilld by moans the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
the boy gives warning something doth approach
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight to cross my obsequies and true loves rite
what with a torch
muffle me night awhile
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father
give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course
why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my ladys face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence be gone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savagewild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea
i will be gone sir and not trouble you
so shalt thou show me friendship
take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
none his looks i fear and his intents i doubt
thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite ill cram thee with more food
this is that banishd haughty montague that murderd my loves cousin with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies i will apprehend him
stop thy unhallowd toil vile montague
can vengeance be pursued further than death
condemned villain i do apprehend thee obey and go with me for thou must die
i must indeed and therefore came i hither
good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man fly hence and leave me think upon these gone let them affright thee
i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury o be gone
by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither armd against myself stay not be gone live and hereafter say a madmans mercy bade thee run away
i do defy thy conjurations and apprehend thee for a felon here
wilt thou provoke me
then have at thee boy
o lord they fight
i will go call the watch
o i am slain
if thou be merciful open the tomb lay me with juliet
in faith i will
let me peruse this face
mercutios kinsman noble county paris
what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode
i think he told me paris should have married juliet said he not so
or did i dream it so
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so
o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortunes book
ill bury thee in a triumphant grave a grave
o no
a lantern slaughterd youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light
death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry
which their keepers call a lightning before death o how may i call this a lightning
o my love
my wife
death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquerd beautys ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and deaths pale flag is not advanced there
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
o what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy
forgive me cousin
ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this worldwearied flesh
eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace
and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death
come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
heres to my love
o true apothecary
thy drugs are quick
thus with a kiss i die
saint francis be my speed
how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves
whos there
heres one a friend and one that knows you well
bliss be upon you
tell me good my friend what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls
as i discern it burneth in the capels monument
it doth so holy sir and theres my master one that you love
who is it
romeo
how long hath he been there
full half an hour
go with me to the vault
i dare not sir my master knows not but i am gone hence and fearfully did menace me with death if i did stay to look on his intents
stay then ill go alone
fear comes upon me o much i fear some ill unlucky thing
as i did sleep under this yewtree here i dreamt my master and another fought and that my master slew him
romeo
alack alack what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre
what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolourd by this place of peace
romeo
o pale
who else
what paris too
and steepd in blood
ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance
the lady stirs
o comfortable friar
where is my lord
i do remember well where i should be and there i am
where is my romeo
i hear some noise
lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents
come come away
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead and paris too
come ill dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns stay not to question for the watch is coming come go good juliet i dare no longer stay
go get thee hence for i will not away
whats here
a cup closed in my true loves hand
poison i see hath been his timeless end o churl
drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after
i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make die with a restorative
thy lips are warm
none yea noise
then ill be brief
o happy dagger
this is thy sheath there rust and let me die
this is the place there where the torch doth burn
the ground is bloody search about the churchyard go some of you whoeer you find attach
pitiful sight
here lies the county slain and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead who here hath lain these two days buried
go tell the prince run to the capulets raise up the montagues some others search we see the ground whereon these woes do lie but the true ground of all these piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry
heres romeos man we found him in the churchyard
hold him in safety till the prince come hither
here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side
a great suspicion stay the friar too
what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our mornings rest
what should it be that they so shriek abroad
the people in the street cry romeo some juliet and some paris and all run with open outcry toward our monument
what fear is this which startles in our ears
sovereign here lies the county paris slain and romeo dead and juliet dead before warm and new killd
search seek and know how this foul murder comes
here is a friar and slaughterd romeos man with instruments upon them fit to open these dead mens tombs
o heavens
o wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mistaenfor lo his house is empty on the back of montague and it missheathed in my daughters bosom
o me
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre
come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down
alas my liege my wife is dead tonight grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath what further woe conspires against mine age
look and thou shalt see
o thou untaught
what manners is in this
to press before thy father to a grave
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion
i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused
then say at once what thou dost know in this
i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriageday was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined
you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutord by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowd grave being the time the potions force should cease
but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead
she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law
we still have known thee for a holy man
wheres romeos man
what can he say in this
i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father and threatened me with death going in the vault i departed not and left him there
give me the letter i will look on it
where is the countys page that raised the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place
he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch
this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
where be these enemies
capulet
montague
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd
o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand
but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet
as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie poor sacrifices of our enmity
a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo
