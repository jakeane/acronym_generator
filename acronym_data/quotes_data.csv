behind an able man there are always other able men
as we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities
we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done
ability is of little account without opportunity
they are able because they think they are able
greater things are believed of those who are absent
absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate
the longest absence is less perilous to love than the terrible trials of incessant proximity
failing to be there when a man wants her is a womans greatest sin except to be there when he doesnt want her
absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones just as the wind blows out a candle and fans a fire
it takes time for the absent to assume their true shape in our thoughts
after death they take on a firmer outline and then cease to change
sometimes when one person is missing the whole world seems depopulated
the absent are always wrong
absence makes the heart grow fonder
absent in body but present in spirit
achilles absent was achilles still
let no one be willing to speak ill of the absent
some people confuse acceptance with apathy but theres all the difference in the world

ill look unblinkingly at the reality of it
but ill also open my hands to accept willingly whatever a loving father sends me

the happy and efficient people in this world are those who accept trouble as a normal detail of human life and resolve to capitalize it when it comes along
for those who live neither with religious consolations about death nor with a sense of death or of anything else as natural death is the obscene mystery the ultimate affront the thing that cannot be controlled
it can only be denied
who except the gods can live without any pain
misfortune comes to all men
the real world is not easy to live in
it is rough it is slippery
without the most cleareyed adjustments we fall and get crushed

maturity is achieved when a person accepts life as full of tension
yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and dreary

there is no armor against fate death lays his icy hands on kings

take pain as it comes and you can better master it
it is right it should be so man was made for joy and woe and when this we rightly know through the world we safely go
anyone who proposes to do good must not expect people to roll stones out of his way but must accept his lot calmly even if they roll a few more upon it

you have come into a hard world
i know of only one easy place in it and that is the grave
against necessity against its strength no one can fight and win
a wise man never refuses anything to necessity
when necessity speaks it demands
how base a thing it is when a man will struggle with necessity
we have to die
whatever isis best
anything in life that we dont accept will simply make trouble for us until we make peace with it
the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself
much sheer effort goes into avoiding the truth left to itself it sweeps in like the tide

a man must live in the world and make the best of it such as it is
there are some people that you cannot change you must either swallow them whole or leave them alone
the world is not to be put in order the world is order incarnate
it is for us to put ourselves in unison with this order
god asks no man whether he will accept life
this is not the choice
you must take it
the only question is how
there is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval
no man can have society upon his own terms
the most popular persons are those who take the world as it is who find the least fault
if you bear the cross unwillingly you make it a burden and load yourself more heavily but you must bear it
there are two ways of meeting difficulties you alter the difficulties or you alter yourself to meet them
i find that it is not the circumstances in which we are placed but the spirit in which we face them that constitutes our comfort
it is almost more important how a person takes his fate than what it is
the individual who is best prepared for any occupation is the one  able to adapt himself to any situation
to act with common sense according to the moment is the best wisdom and the best philosophy is to do ones duties to take the world as it comes submit respectfully to ones lot and bless the goodness that has given us so much happiness with it whatever it is
the art of life lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings
to repel ones cross is to make it heavier
ask not that events should happen as you will but let your will be that events should happen as they do and you shall have peace
the survival of the fittest is the ageless law of nature but the fittest are rarely the strong
the fittest are those endowed with the qualifications for adaptation the ability to accept the inevitable and conform to the unavoidable to harmonize with existing or changing conditions
the ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace making the best of circumstances
he is happy whose circumstances suit his temper but he is more excellent who can suit his temper to any circumstances

today i know that i cannot control the ocean tides
i can only go with the flow
when i struggle and try to organize the atlantic to my specifications i sink
if i flail and thrash and growl and grumble i go under
but if i let go and float i am borne aloft
one learns to adapt to the land in which one lives
she had believed the land was her enemy and she struggled against it but you could not make war against a land any more than you could against the sea

flow with whatever may happen and let your mind be free
stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing
this is the ultimate
when you have got an elephant by the hind legs and he is trying to run away it is best to let him run
learn to drink the cup of life as it comes
arrange whatever pieces come your way
everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change
so suffering must become love
that is the mystery
you cant fight the desert you have to ride with it
all i can do is play the game the way the cards fall
dont be sad dont be angry if life deceives you
submit to your grief your time for joy will come believe me
when we see ourselves in a situation which must be endured and gone through it is best to meet it with firmness and accommodate everything to it in the best way practicable
this lessens the evil while fretting and fuming only increase your own torments
always fall in with what youre asked to accept my aim in life has always been to hold my own with whatevers going
not against with

the best thing we can do is to make wherever were lost look as much like home as we can
make a virtue of necessity
cooperation is doing with a smile what you have to do anyhow
we must make the best of those ills which cannot be avoided
for so must it be and help me do my part
there are no conditions to which a man cannot become accustomed
a private railroad car is not an acquired taste
one takes to it immediately
man adapts himself to everything to the best and the worst
being unready and illequipped is what you have to expect in life
it is the universal predicament
it is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes
circumstances are seldom right
you never have the capacities the strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have
you must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen as appropriate for your special endowments
in the face of an obstacle which is impossible to overcome stubbornness is stupid
very few live by choice
every man is placed in his present condition by causes which acted without his foresight and with which he did not always willingly cooperate and therefore you will rarely meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbor better than his own
to exist is to adapt and if one could not adapt one died and made room for those who could

the resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering
the chief pang of most trials is not so much the actual suffering itself as our own spirit of resistance to it
each of us does in effect strike a series of deals or compromises between the wants and longings of the inner self and an outer environment that offers certain possibilities and sets certain limitations
man is the only animal that laughs and weeps for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they might have been

we all have the conviction perhaps illusory that we have much more to say than appears on the paper
the greatest and most important problems in life are all in a certain sense insoluble
they can never be solved but only outgrown
we do not write as we want but as we can
the art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them
a body shouldnt heed what might be
hes got to do with what is
the greatest evil which fortune can inflict on men is to endow them with small talents and great ambitions
we may fail of our happiness strive we ever so bravely but we are less likely to fail if we measure with judgment our chances and our capabilities
i one of the signs of maturity is a healthy respect for realitya respect that manifests itself in the level of ones aspirations and in the accuracy of ones assessment of the difficulties which separate the facts of today from the bright hopes of tomorrow
is life so wretched
isnt it rather your hands which are too small your vision which is muddled
you are the one who must grow up
nothing you write if you hope to be any good will ever come out as you first hoped
unhappiness is best defined as the difference between our talents and our expectations
anxiety is that range of distress which attends willing what cannot be willed
there is a mortal breed most full of futility

a life of frustration is inevitable for any coach whose man enjoyment is winning
no traveler eer reached that blest abode who found not thorns and briers in his road
the trouble with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than with their minds

adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live
when we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm miracles can happen
love only what befalls you and is spun for you by fate
what you cant get out of get into wholeheartedly
let us train our minds to desire what the situation demands
ride the horse in the direction that its going
if one has to submit it is wasteful not to do so with the best grace possible
since god has been pleased to give us the papacy let us enjoy it
it is no use to grumble and complain its just as cheap and easy to rejoice when god sorts out the weather and sends rainwhy rains my choice
when a dog runs at you whistle for him
an oak and a reed were arguing about their strength
when a strong wind came up the reed avoided being uprooted by bending and leaning with the gusts of wind
but the oak stood firm and was torn up by the roots
the grass must bend when the wind blows across it
he who attempts to resist the wave is swept away but he who bends before it abides
adapt or perish now as ever is natures inexorable imperative
one does not have to stand again the gale

life is not always what one wants it to be but to make the best of it as it is is the only way of being happy
everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
i accept life unconditionally

most people ask for happiness on condition
happiness can only be felt if you dont set any condition
happiness is a function of accepting what is
ones first step in wisdom is to question everything ones last is to come to terms with everything
if you are wise live as you can if you cannot live as you would
wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it cant bring down
for this is wisdom to live to take what fate or the gods may give
acceptance and work if you have a job without aggravations you dont have a job
when i decided to go into politics i weighed the costs
i would get criticism
but i went ahead

i was better able to handle it
every job has drudgery

the first secret of happiness is the recognition of this fundamental fact
the fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore
he who doesnt accept the conditions of life sells his soul
greatness of soul consists not so much in soaring high and in pressing forward as in knowing how to adapt and limit oneself
the beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another not because he does not feel them but because he is a man of high and heroic temper
the great soul surrenders itself to fate
the mind which renounces once and forever a futile hope has its compensations in evergrowing calm
i not only bow to the inevitable i am fortified by it
i have accepted all and i am free
the inner chains are broken as well as those outside
the most beautiful thing is inevitability of events and the most ugly thing is trying to resist inevitability
peace of mind is that mental condition in which you have accepted the worst
if we can recognize that change and uncertainty are basic principles we can greet the future and the transformation we are undergoing with the understanding that we do not know enough to be pessimistic
we cannot change anything unless we accept it
acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequence of any misfortune
almost any event will put on a new face when received with cheerful acceptance
what it is forbidden to be put right becomes lighter by acceptance
one completely overcomes only what one assimilates
if you cast away one cross you will certainly find another and perhaps a heavier
to repel ones cross is to make it heavier
science says we must live and seeks the means of prolonging increasing facilitating and amplifying life of making it tolerable and acceptable wisdom says we must die and seeks how to make us die well
true freedom lies in the realization and calm acceptance of the fact that there may very well be no perfect answer
as the soft yield of water cleaves obstinate stone so to yield with life solves the insolvable to yield i have learned is to come back again
things turn out best for people who make the best of the way things turn out
and acceptance is the answer to all my problems today

i can find no serenity until i accept that person place thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment
resistance causes pain and lethargy
it is when we practice acceptance that new possibilities appear
to oppose something is to maintain it

those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly
nature to be commanded must be obeyed
the first step toward change is acceptance
once you accept yourself you open the door to change
thats all you have to do
change is not something you do its something you allow
keep doing what youre doing and youll keep getting what youre getting
everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change
so suffering must become love
that is the mystery
we cannot change anything unless we accept it
condemnation does not liberate it oppresses
when you make your peace with authority you become authority
ours must be the first age whose great goal on a nonmaterial plane is not fulfillment but adjustment
woman must not accept she must challenge
we have fought this fight as long and as well as we know how
we have been defeated

better to accept whatever happens
if we cannot do what we will we must will what we can

what cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear
i will not meddle with that which i cannot mend
i have learned to live with it all whatever happens  all of it
there is no such thing as pure pleasure some anxiety always goes with it
if a ship has been sunk i cant bring it up
if it is going to be sunk i cant stop it
i can use my time much better working on tomorrows problem than by fretting about yesterdays
besides if i let those things get me i wouldnt last long
one of the many lessons that one learns in prison is that things are what they are and will be what they will be

but ill also open my hands to accept willingly whatever a loving father sends me

happiness is experienced when your life gives you what you are willing to accept
acceptance is the truest kinship with humanity
what must be shall be and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing
acceptance makes any event put on a new face
there is no sense in the struggle but there is no choice but to struggle
boys this is only a game
but its like life in that you will be dealt some bad hands
take each hand good or bad and dont whine and complain but play it out
if youre men enough to do that god will help and you will come out well
practice easing your way along
dont get het up or in a dither
do your best take it as it comes
you can handle anything if you think you can
just keep your cool and your sense of humor

there is no such thing as bad publicity except your own obituary
the advertisements in a newspaper are more full of knowledge in respect to what is going on in a state or community than the editorial columns are

in advertising not to be different is virtually suicidal
advertising  a judicious mixture of flattery and threats
advertising may be described as the science of arresting the human intelligence long enough to get money from it
the best ad is a good product
the philosophy behind much advertising is based on the old observation that every man is really two men  the man he is and the man he wants to be
the number of agency people required to shoot a commercial on location is in direct proportion to the mean temperature of the location

the advice of the elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books

advice is seldom welcome and those who want it the most always like it the least

many receive advice only the wise profit by it

arguments out of a petty mouth are unanswerable
many can argue not many converse
wise men argue causes and fools decide them
when bishop berkeley said there was no matter and proved it  twas no matter what he said
neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
i am bound to furnish my antagonists with arguments but not with comprehension
strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause
insolence is not logic epithets are the arguments of malice
myself when young did eagerly frequent doctor and saint and heard great argument about it and about but evermore came out by the same door where in i went

you get dirty and besides the pig likes it
the test of a man or womans breeding is how they behave in a quarrel
i have never in my life learned anything from any man who agreed with me

one must learn to paint these simple figures and then one can do all that he may wish
fine art is that in which the hand the head and the heart of man go together

i think there is no work of art which represents the spirit of a nation more surely than die meister singer of richard wagner
here is no plaything with local colour but the raising to its highest power all that is best in the national consciousness of his country
i wonder whether art has a higher function than to make me feel appreciate and enjoy natural objects for their art value
ive been 40 years discovering that the queen of all colours is black
if artists and poets are unhappy it is after all because happiness does not interest them
interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art
one of the most difficult things to do is to paint darkness which nonetheless has light in it

the scholar seeks the artist finds
the song of the brush
theatre takes place all the time wherever one is and art simply facilitates persuading one this is the case
two boys arrived yesterday with a pebble they said was the head of a dog until i pointed out that it was really a typewriter

art is i science is we
the artist like the god of the creation remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork invisible refined out of existence indifferent paring his fingernails
designers and free lance artists and editors can set their hourly rates by dividing their annual income needs by 1000
children like animals use all their senses to discover the world
then artists come along and discover it the same way all over again
when power leads man toward arrogance poetry reminds him of his limitations
when power narrows the areas of mans concern poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his experience
when power corrupts poetry cleanses
for art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstones of our judgement
the artist


faithful to his personal vision of reality becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an offensive state
art is the expression of an enormous preference
conception my boy fundamental brainwork is what makes the difference in all art
an artist may visit a museum but only a pedant can live there
all profoundly original art looks ugly at first
pioneers did not produce original works of art because they were creating original human environments they did not imagine utopias because they were shaping them
art is a human activity consisting in this that one man consciously by means of external signs hands on to others feelings he has worked through and other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them
a picture lives by companionship
it dies by the same token
it is therefore risky to send it out into the world
how often it must be impaired by the eyes of the unfeeling
abstract art is uniquely modern
it is a fundamentally romantic response to modern life  rebellious individualistic unconventional sensitive irritable
culture is something you cannot buy something you cannot import something you cannot learn or produce at will
a writer an artist or musician cannot sit down and say now i will produce culture
culture is something that evolves out of the simple enduring elements of everyday life elements most truthfully expressed in the folk arts and crafts of a nation
dance is the only art of which we ourselves are the stuff of which it is made
art is not an end in itself but a means of addressing humanity
all art is a revolt against mans fate
art is a delayed echo
art is a kind of illness
one must work nothing but work and one must have patience
art does not reproduce the visible rather it makes it visible
the more horrifying this world becomes the more art becomes abstract
one of the recognizable features of the authentic masterpiece is its capacity to renew itself to endure the loss of some kinds of immediate relevance while still answering the most important questions men can ask including new ones they are just learning how to frame
every child is an artist
the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up
art is mans nature nature is gods art
with the pride of the artist you must blow against the walls of every power that exists the small trumpet of your defiance
all art is a kind of confession more or less oblique
all artists if they are to survive are forced at last to tell the whole story to vomit the anguish up
history repeats itself but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced
it is utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird
if you ask me what i came to do in this world i an artist i will answer you t am here to live out loud
illustrations have as much to say as the text
the trick is to say the same thing but in a different way
its no good being an illustrator who is saying a lot that is on his or her mind if it has nothing to do with the text


the artist must override the story but he must also override his own ego for the sake of the story
in any evolutionary process even in the arts the search for novelty becomes corrupting
the cheap no matter how charming how immediate does not wear so well
it has a way of telling its whole story the first time through
a work of art is a corner of creation seen through a temperament
art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life
art gropes it stalks like a hunter lost in the woods listening to itself and to everything around it unsure of itself waiting to pounce
man in canadian art is rarely in command of his environment or ever at home in it
whats an artist but the dregs of his work  the human shambles that follows it around
art has no other object than to set aside the symbols of practical utility the generalities that are conventionally and socially accepted everything in fact which masks reality from us in order to set us face to face with reality itself
every artist preserves deep within him a single source from which throughout his lifetime he draws what he is and what he says and when the source dries up the work withers and crumbles
as an artist grows older he has to fight disillusionment and learn to establish the same relation to nature as an adult as he had when a child
perpetual modernness is the measure of merit in every work of art
nothing can come out of an artist that is not in the man
it is not in life but in art that selffulfillment is to be found
an artist never really finishes his work he merely abandons it
i am convinced it is a mistake to find an artist human outside his work
if you cannot find him human in and through his work you are better not to know it when you come to formulate an opinion of his public value
one must work nothing but work and one must have patience
art does not reproduce the visible rather it makes it visible
the more horrifying this world becomes the more art becomes abstract
one of the recognizable features of the authentic masterpiece is its capacity to renew itself to endure the loss of some kinds of immediate relevance while still answering the most important questions men can ask including new ones they are just learning how to frame
every child is an artist
the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up

the artist must override the story but he must also override his own ego for the sake of the story
in any evolutionary process even in the arts the search for novelty becomes corrupting
the cheap no matter how charming how immediate does not wear so well
it has a way of telling its whole story the first time through
art at its most significant is a distant early warning system that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it
it is well with me only when i have a chisel in my hand
art is based on order
the world is full of sloppy bohemians and their work betrays them
living is a form of not being sure not knowing what next or how
the moment you know how you begin to die a little
the artist never entirely knows
we guess
we may be wrong but we take leap after leap in the dark
the artist like the idiot or clown sits on the edge of the world and a push may send him over it
artspeech is the only truth
an artist is usually a damned liar but his art if it be art will tell you the truth of his day
and that is all that matters
away with eternal truth
the truth lives from day to day and the marvelous plato of yesterday is chiefly bosh today
art isnt something you marry its something you rape
its not what you see that is art art is the gap
i always suspect an artist who is successful before he is dead
an artist has to take life as he finds it
life by itself is formless wherever it is
art must give it form
art upsets science reassures
an artist has been defined as a neurotic who continually cures himself with his art
art is either plagiarism or revolution
the father of every good work is discontent and its mother is diligence
a work should contain its total meaning within itself and should impress it on the spectator before he even knows the subject
the terror of art lies in the representation of the hidden reality with its shattering effect
drawing is speaking to the eye talking is painting to the ear
we should comport ourselves with the masterpieces of art as with exalted personages  stand quietly before them and wait till they speak to us
be regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois so that you may be violent and original in your work
the painting rises from the brushstrokes as a poem rises from the words
the meaning comes later
caricature is rough truth
a work of art is an exaggeration
art not only imitates nature but also completes its deficiencies
when one admires an artist it is important not to know him personally
art for arts sake
art as far as it is able follows nature as a pupil imitates his master thus your art must be as it were gods grandchild
great art is as irrational as great music
it is mad with its own loveliness
a picture is a poem without words
art hath an enemy called ignorance
its clever but is it art
art is not an end in itself but a means of addressing humanity
art is a kind of illness
art is indeed not the bread but the wine of life
art is difficult transient is her reward
the artist does not see things as they are but as he is
when a dove begins to associate with crows its feathers remain white but its heart grows black
if you always live with those who are lame you will yourself learn to limp
he that walketh with wise men shall be wise
i am an atheist thank god
i dont believe in god because i dont believe in mother goose
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god
that the universe was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms i will no more believe than that the accidental jumbling of the alphabet would fall into a most ingenious treatise of philosophy
by night an atheist half believes in god
audacity more audacity always audacity
fortune favors the audacious
every great advance in natural knowledge has involved die absolute rejection of authority
all authority belongs to the people
the highest duty is to respect authority
he who writes prose builds his temple to fame in rubble he who writes verses builds it in granite
the pen is the tongue of the mind
the author who speaks about his own books is almost as bad as a mother who talks about her own children
an incurable itch for scribbling takes possession of many and grows inveterate in their insane breasts
you do not publish your own verses laelius you criticise mine
pray cease to criticise mine or else publish your own
the ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr
the melancholy days have come the saddest of the year of wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown and sear
the years in the wane there is nothing adoring the night has no eve and the day has no morning cold winter gives warning
o it sets my heart a clickin like the tickin of a clock when the frost is on the punkin and the fodders in the shock
what can you conceive more silly and extravagant than to suppose a man racking his brains and studying night and day how to fly
the birds can fly an why cant i
he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind
here we have baby
it is composed of a bald head and a pair of lungs
where did you come from baby dear
out of the everywhere into here
rockabye baby on the tree top when the wind blows the cradle will rock when the bough bends the cradle will fall down comes the baby cradle and all
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
hush my dear lie still and slumber holy angels guard thy bed
heavenly blessings without number gently falling on thy head
sweetest lil feller everybody knows dunno what to call him but hes mighty lak a rose lookin at his mammy wid eyes so shiny blue mek you think that heavn is comin clost ter you
a bachelor is one who enjoys the chase but does not eat the game
a bachelor is a souvenir of some woman who found a better one at the last minute
the best work and of greatest merit for the public has proceeded from the unmarried or childless men
a single man has not nearly the value he would have in a state of union
he is an incomplete animal
he resembles the odd half of a pair of scissors
by persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation
a banker is a man who lends you an umbrella when the weather is fair and takes it away from you when it rains
banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies
it takes two to make a bargain
its a bad bargain where nobody gains
the best of a bad bargain

do you love me because im beautiful or am i beautiful because you love me
beauty is everlasting and dust is for a time
beauty more than bitterness makes the heart break
things are beautiful if you love them
we ascribe beauty to that which is simple which has no superfluous parts which exactly answers its ends
something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul
beauty is the purgation of superfluities
beauty  the adjustment of all parts proportionately so that one cannot add or subtract or change without impairing the harmony of the whole
underneath this stone doth lie as much beauty as could die
there is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion
a very beautiful woman hardly ever leaves a clearcut impression of features and shape in the memory usually there remains only an aura of living colour

im tired of all the nonsense about beauty being only skindeep
thats deep enough
what do you want  an adorable pancreas
the fountain of beauty is the heart and every generous thought illustrates the walls of your chamber
beauty as we feel it is something indescribable what it is or what it means can never be said
things are beautiful if you love them
there is certainly no absolute standard of beauty
that precisely is what makes its pursuit so interesting
a thing of beauty is a joy forever
when your inner eyes open you can find immense beauty hidden within the inconsequential details of daily life
when your inner ears open you can hear the subtle lovely music of the universe everywhere you go

beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror
a thing of beauty is a joy forever
beauty is truth truth beauty
she walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all thats best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies

in bed we laugh in bed we cry and born in bed in bed we die the near approach a bed may show of human bliss to human woe

love is what happens to men and women who dont know each other

how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
love is
the flower of life and blossoms unexpectedly and without law and must be plucked where it is found and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration
first love is a kind of vaccination which saves a man from catching the complaint the second time
at the touch of love everyone becomes a poet
love is like quicksilver in the hand
leave the fingers open and it stays
clutch it and it darts away
love is a madness if thwarted it develops fast
love is like war easy to begin but hard to end
falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the commonsense
i have learned not to worry about love but to honor its coming with all my heart
i believe in love but i dont sit around waiting for it
what is irritating about love is that it is a crime that requires an accomplice
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation
it is too long ago
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun
many people when they fall in love look for a little haven of refuge from the world where they can be sure of being admired when they are not admirable and praised when they are not praiseworthy
the art of love  is largely the art of persistence
it is an extra dividend when you like the girl youve fallen in love with
you cant buy love but you can pay heavily for it
how delicious is the winning of a kiss at loves beginning
love is a deep well from which you may drink often but into which you may fall but once

a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet
men willingly believe what they wish
believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear
a man must not swallow more beliefs than he can digest
he that believeth not shall be damned
nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know
she deceiving i believing what need lovers wish for more
curfew must not ring tonight
those evening bells
those evening bells
how many a tale their music tells
ring out the old ring in the new ring happy bells across the snow
biography is the only true history
one anecdote of a man is worth a volume of biography
lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time
to be ignorant of the lives of the most celebrated men of antiquity is to continue in a state of childhood all our days

a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
o thrush your song is passing sweet but never a song that you have sung is half so sweet as thrushes sang when my dear love and i were young
birds of a feather will flock together
and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore

husbands dont really count  in the miracle of birth
and when i was born i drew in the common air and fell upon the earth which is of like nature and the first voice which i uttered was crying as all others do

you can live to be a hundred if you give up all the things that make you want to live to a hundred
she claims she just turned thirty but it must have been a uturn
shes not pushing forty shes dragging it

actually being sixtyfive isnt so bad
as a matter of fact i rather like being called a sexagenarian

age is mind over matter

shes too young for medicare and too old for me to care
when she told me her age i believed her  why not
she hasnt changed her story for five years
there are three signs of old age loss of memory

remember when we used to laugh at old people when we were young
do you recall what was so funny

gray hair is gods graffiti

here we have a baby
it is composed of a bald head and a pair of lungs
men will now get up and walk with the baby in the middle of the night change its diapers and give it a bottle but in their heart of hearts they still think they shouldnt have to

fortune favours the bold
a stout heart breaks bad luck
all good fortune is a gift of the gods and  you dont win the favor of the ancient gods by being good but by being bold
fortune reveres the brave and overwhelms the cowardly
fortune sides with him who dares

get as much experience as you can so that youre ready when luck works
thats the luck
youve got to be in a position for luck to happen
luck doesnt go around looking for a stumblebum
luck is the residue of design
luck affects everything
let your hook be always cast
in the stream where you least expect it there will be fish
chance does nothing that has not been prepared beforehand
luck is being ready for the chance
chance usually favors the prudent man
combine common sense and the golden rule and you will have very little bad luck
luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity

every charitable act is a stepping stone toward heaven
my poor are my best patients
god pays for them
though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing

im not happy im cheerful
theres a difference
a happy woman has no cares at all
a cheerful woman has cares but has learned how to deal with them
the clearest sign of wisdom is continued cheerfulness
cheerfulness is as natural to the heart of man in strong health as color to his cheek and wherever there is habitual gloom there must be either bad air unwholesome food improperly severe labor or erring habits of life
cheerfulness prepares a glorious mind for all the noblest acts
a man of gladness seldom falls into madness
always let them think of you as singing and dancing

children have more need of models than of critics
children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardour for their curiosity their intolerance of shams the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision

children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them
ask your child what he wants for dinner only if he is buying
all children wear the sign i want to be important now
many of our juvenile delinquency problems arise because nobody reads the sign
if a child lives with approval he learns to live with himself
your children are not dead
they are just waiting until the world deserves them
whats done to children they will do to society
the hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any
unlike grownups children have little need to deceive themselves
weve had bad luck with our kids  theyve all grown up
there are only two lasting bequests we can hope to give our children
one of these is roots the other wings
give me the children until they are seven and anyone may have them afterwards
there are only two things a child will share willingly  communicable diseases and his mothers age
do not mistake a child for his symptom
babies are such a nice way to start people
children need love especially when they do not deserve it
if a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder without any such gift from the fairies he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with him the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in
nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived lives of the parents
books  rarely if ever talk about what children can make of themselves about the powers that from the day or moment of birth are present in every child
i do not choose to run for president in 1928
betwixt the devil and the deap sea
theres small choice in rotten apples

for many are called but few are chosen
in every pang that rends the heart the man of sorrows had a part
the sages and heroes of history are receding from us and history contracts the record of their deeds into a narrower and narrower page
but time has no power over the name and deeds and words of jesus christ
jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever
the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
jesus was made a little lower than the angels
all his glory and beauty come from within and there he delights to dwell his visits there are frequent his conversation sweet his comforts refreshing and his peace passing all understanding
alexander caesar charlemagne and i myself have founded empires but upon what do these creations of our genius depend

count her every precious shrine tell to afterages tell fortified by power divine the church can never fail
the itch of disputing is the scab of the churches
the long arm of coincidence

i am a citizen not of athens or greece but of the world
paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city
this poor little onehorse town
if you would know and not be known live in a city
god made the country and man made the town
cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining but they make them artificial
in the busy haunts of men
far from gay cities and the way of men
ye are the light of the world
a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid
the people are the city
civilization is nothing more than the effort to reduce the use of force to the last resort
each new generation is a fresh invasion of savages
respectability is the dickey on the bosom of civilization
the human race has improved everything except the human race
a civilized society is one that exhibits the five qualities of truth beauty adventure art and peace
there is such a thing as too much couth
we are in the first age since the dawn of civilization in which people have dared to think it practicable to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race
the human landscape of the new world shows a conquest of nature by an intelligence that does not love it
let us humour if we can the vertical man though we value none but the horizontal one
any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
our lifetime may be the last that will be lived out in a technological society
to be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization
so i should say that civilizations begin with religion and stoicism they end with scepticism and unbelief and the undisciplined pursuit of individual pleasure
a civilization is born stoic and dies epicurean
we are all afraid  for our confidence for the future for the world
that is the nature of the human imagination
yet every man every civilization has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do
the personal commitment and the emotional commitment working together as one has made the ascent of man
civilization is just a slow process of learning to be kind
civilization is a movement  not a condition a voyage  not a harbour
since barbarism has its pleasures it naturally has its apologists
we sit by and watch the barbarian
we tolerate him in the long stretches of peace we are not afraid
we are tickled by his irreverence his comic inversion of our old certitudes and our fixed creed refreshes us we laugh
but as we laugh we are watched by large and awful faces from beyond and on these faces there are no smiles
a race preserves its vigour so long as it harbours a real contrast between what has been and what may be and so long as it is nerved by the vigour to adventure beyond the safeties of the past
without adventure civilization is in full decay
civilizations die from philosophical calm irony and the sense of fair play quite as surely as they die of debauchery
the three great elements of modern civilization gunpowder printing and the protestant religion
a savage is simply a human organism that has not received enough news from the human race
this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
a tablecloth restaurant is still one of the great rewards of civilization
the end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization
if you would civilize a man begin with his grandmother
to be a man is to feel that ones own stone contributes to building the edifice of the world
a sufficient measure of civilization is the influence of good women
we think our civilization near its meridian but we are yet only at the cockcrowing and the morning star
the path of civilization is paved with tin cans
nations like individuals live and die but civilization cannot die
civilization is a movement and not a condition a voyage and not a harbor
all will come out in the washing
wash you make you clean
god loveth the clean

politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement
as a career the business of an orthodox preacher is about as successful as that of a celluloid dog chasing an asbestos cat through hell
the life of a conscientious clergyman is not easy
i have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain

the defects of a preacher are soon spied
cleverness is serviceable for everything sufficient for nothing
cleverness is not wisdom
be good sweet maid and let who will be clever
the clothes make the man
whenas in silks my julia goes then then methinks how sweetly flows the liquefaction of her clothes
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man
the soul of this man is his clothes
she wears her clothes as if they were thrown on her with a pitchfork
the ideal committee is one with me as chairman and two other members in bed with flu
if moses had been a committee the israelites would still be in egypt
a committee of one gets things done
a camel is a horse designed by a committee
if columbus had had an advisory committee he would probably still be at the dock
an institution is the lengthening shadow of one man
i do not care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members
those mausoleums of inactive masculinity are places for men who prefer armchairs to women
what is a committee
a group of the unwilling picked from the unfit to do the unnecessary
no grand idea was ever born in a conference but a lot of foolish ideas have died there

blue is true yellows jealous greens forsaken reds brazen white is love and black is death
more pernicious nonsense was never devised by man than treaties of commerce
commerce links all mankind in one common brotherhood of mutual dependence and interests
commerce is the equalizer of the wealth of nations
whatever has a tendency to promote the civil intercourse of nations by an exchange of benefits is a subject as worthy of philosophy as of politics
what distinguishes the majority of men from the few is their ability to act accordingly to their beliefs
what a man believes he will die for
what a man merely thinks he will change his mind about
when you have decided what you believe what you feel must be done have the courage to stand alone and be counted
the eloquent man is he who is no beautiful speaker but who is inwardly and desperately drunk with a certain belief
a belief which does not spring from a conviction in the emotions is no belief at all
whether you are really right or not doesnt matter its the belief that counts
many a man has walked up to the opportunity for which he has long been preparing himself looked it full in the face and then begun to get cold feet when it comes to betting on yourself and your power to do the thing you know you must do or write yourself down a failure youre a chickenlivered coward if you hesitate
the wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket

lifes point of no return
even now we can draw back
but once we cross that little bridge we must settle things by the sword
you dont know what pressure is until you play for 5 with only 2 in your pocket
the fixed determination to have acquired the warrior soul to either conquer or perish with honor is the secret of victory
in war there is no substitute for victory
victory at all costs victory in spite of all terror victory however long and hard the road may be for without victory there is no survival
better that we should die fighting than be outraged and dishonored
better to die than to live in slavery
i sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is but it does not admit of holidays

whats the alternative
what do you want most to do
thats what i have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties
i am a stranger to half measures
perform without fail what you resolve
to say yes you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows
it is easy to say no even if saying no means death
what one has one ought to use and whatever he does he should do with all his might
nothings far when one wants to get there
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might
he that rides his hobby gently must always give way to him that rides his hobby hard
stay up and really burn the midnight oil
there are no compromises
nothing of worthy or weight can be achieved with half a mind with a faint heart and with a lame endeavor

morality like physical cleanliness is not acquired once and for all it can only be kept and renewed by a habit of constant watchfulness and discipline
firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character and one of the best instruments of success
without it genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies
my face is set my gait is fast my goal is heaven my road is narrow my way is rough my companions are few my guide is reliable my mission is clear
i cannot be bought compromised detoured lured away turned back diluted or delayed

one advantage of marriage it seems to me is that when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you it keeps you together until you maybe fall in love again
you cant try to do things you simply must do them
i am in earnest i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard
if you dont make a total commitment to whatever youre doing then you start looking to bail out the first time the boat starts leaking
its tough enough getting that boat to shore with everybody rowing let alone when a guy stands up and starts putting his life jacket on
when i stand before god at the end of my life i would hope that i would not have a single bit of talent left and could say i used everything you gave me
it seems safe to say that significant discovery really creative thinking does not occur with regard to problems about which the thinker is lukewarm
if a man hasnt discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live
moderation in war is imbecility
let my name stand among those who are willing to bear ridicule and reproach for the truths sake and so earn some right to rejoice when the victory is won
getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself
you must be able to sustain yourself against staggering blows
there is no code of conduct to help beginners
that is why some people with mediocre talent but with great inner drive go much further than people with vastly superior talent
the wonderful thing about saints is that they were human
they lost their tempers got hungry scolded god were egotistical or impatient in their turns made mistakes and regretted them
still they went on doggedly blundering toward heaven
a successful marriage requires falling in love many times always with the same person
winners are men who have dedicated their whole lives to winning
those who love a cause are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it
unless you can find some sort of loyalty you cannot find unity and peace in your active living
sometimes success is due less to ability than zeal
the winner is he who gives himself to his work body and soul
now i am steelset i follow the call to the clear radiance and glow of the heights
love me please i love you i can bear to be your friend
so ask of me anything
i am not a tentative person
whatever i do i give up my whole self to it
i dont care a damn for your loyal service when you think i am right when i really want it most is when you think i am wrong
ones lifework i have learned grows with the working and the living
do it as if your life depended on it and first thing you know youll have made a life out of it
a good life too

the person who makes a success of living is the one who sees his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly
that is dedication
theirs is not to reason why theirs is but to do or die
either do not attempt at all or go through with it
if you start to take vienna take vienna
if you arent going all the way why go at all
you can be an ordinary athlete by getting away with less than your best

the secret of living is to find a pivot the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand
theres nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos
standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous you get knocked down by traffic from both sides
he who walks in the middle of the road gets hit from both sides
i never liked the middle groundthe most boring place in the world
the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in a period of moral crisis maintain their neutrality
the man who sees both sides of an issue is very likely on the fence or up a tree
the middle of the road is where the white line is and thats the worst place to drive
the principle of neutrality  has increasingly become an obsolete conception and except under very special circumstances it is an immoral and shortsighted conception
we know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road
they get run over
show me a person who is not an extremist about some things who is a middleoftheroader in everything and i will show you someone who is insecure
we should not permit tolerance to degenerate into indifference
most people are not for or against anything the first object of getting people together is to make them respond somehow to overcome inertia

nothing is so common as unsuccessful men with talent
they lack only determination

common sense is instinct and enough of it is genius
what is a communist
one who hath yearnings for equal division of unequal earnings idler or bungler or both he is willing to fork out his copper and pocket your shilling
the communist is a socialist in a violent hurry
the theory of communism may be summed up in one sentence abolish all private property
communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak
in communism inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence
if you want to read about love and marriage youve got to buy two separate books
when you are in love with someone you want to be near him all the time except when you are out buying things and charging them to him
a happy marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short
the first duty of love is to listen
you dont marry someone you can live with  you marry the person who you cannot live without
behind every successful man is a surprised woman
love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit
my most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me
sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades but to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day ah now thats a real treat
marriage is not a ritual or an end
it is a long intricate intimate dance together and nothing matters more than your own sense of balance and your choice of partner
love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
i married the first man i ever kissed
when i tell this to my children they just about throw up
love two minds without a single thought
tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons longing as all individuals do to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals can participate in a relationship that for the moment is not of two isolated selves but a union
i recently read that love is entirely a matter of chemistry
that must be why my wife treats me like toxic waste
you cant put a price tag on love but you can on all its accessories
when you love someone all your savedup wishes start coming out
no man is truly married until he understands every word his wife is not saying
to get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with
the whole world loves a lover is an interesting theory but a very bad legal defense
i was married by a judge
i should have asked for a jury

and marriage is an insritution
well im nor ready for an instirurion for rhe blind just yet
i think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage

good fire good marriage same rule

forget rich
love seems the swiftest but it is the slowest of all growths
no man or woman really knows what perfect love is until they have been married a quarter of a century
one of the silliest lines ever said in a feature film came from love story the 1970s hit which immortalized the phrase love means never having to say youre sorry
there are few people who would actually want to share a life with someone who held that concept near and dear
infatuation is when you think hes as sexy as robert redford as smart as henry kissinger as noble as ralph nader as funny as woody allen and as athletic as jimmy conners
love is when you realize that hes as sexy as woody allen as smart as jimmy connors as funny as ralph nader as athletic as henry kissinger and nothing like robert redford  but youll take him anyway
without love what are we worth
eightynine cents
eightynine cents worth of chemicals walking around lonely
love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat
love is like a friendship caught on fire
in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering
as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable
we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love
men love because they are afraid of themselves afraid of the loneliness that lives in them and need someone in whom they can lose themselves as smoke loses itself in the sky
when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible
being in love is something like poetry

i have learned that only two things are necessary to keep ones wife happy
first let her think shes having her own way
and second let her have it
politics doesnt make strange bedfellows  marriage does
someone asked me why women dont gamble as much as men do and i gave the commonsensical reply that we dont have as much money
that was a true and incomplete answer
in fact womens total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage
the secret of a happy marriage remains a secret
ive given my memoirs far more thought than any of my marriages
you cant divorce a book
americans who make more of marrying for love than any other people also break up more of their marriages but the figure reflects not so much the failure of love as the determination of people not to live without it
the highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you
love is what makes two people sit in the middle of a bench when there is plenty of room at both ends
a man loves his sweetheart the most his wife the best but his mother the longest
no woman ever falls in love with a man unless she has a better opinion of him than he deserves
the bravest thing that men do is love women
a woman has to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one
love is passion obsession someone you cant live without
if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with
fall head over heels
i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back
and how do you find him
forget your head and listen to your heart
one of the things my life has taught me is how important it is to try to say i love you in ways that can be preserved looked at and read when you are alone or when there is adversity or when circumstances bring separation
in any case


saying i love you is one of the secrets of the happy marriage that ronnie and i have shared
ronnies letters move me to this day
they are his gift to me across the years and throughout the decades of love
the most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a growing depth beauty and joy as the years increase
this inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it
it is a sort of divine accident and the most wonderful of all things in life
tell me thy company and i will tell thee what thou art
twos a company threes a crowd
we are in the same boat
the right hands of fellowship
comparisons are odious
some say compared to bononcini that mynheer handels but a ninny others aver that he to handel is scarcely fit to hold a candle strange all this difference should be twixt tweedledum and tweedledee
the bee and the serpent often sip from the selfsame flower
if the poor man cannot always get meat the rich man cannot always digest it
tis always morning somewhere in the world
nothing is pure and entire of a piece
all advantages are attended with disadvantages
a universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence
the prickly thorn often bears soft roses
those who complain most are most to be complained of
the usual fortune of complaint is to excite contempt more than pity
complaint is the largest tribute heaven receives
compliments are only lies in court clothes
when two people compliment each other with the choice of anything each of them generally gets that which he likes least
compliments and flattery oftenest excite my contempt by the pretension they imply for who is he that assumes to flatter me
to compliment often implies an assumption of superiority in the complimenter
it is in fact a subtle detraction
all government  indeed every human benefit and enjoyment every virtue and every prudent act  is founded on compromise and barter
compromise makes a good umbrella but a poor roof it is a temporary expedient often wise in party politics almost sure to be unwise in statesmanship
better bend than break
no man was ever so much deceived by another as by himself
the art of making much show with little substance
seest thou a man wise in his own conceit
there is more hope of a fool than of him
the ability to concentrate and to use your time well is everything
it is only when i dally with what i am about look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward that i feel these cold sinkings of the heart
a straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective
nothing interferes with my concentration
you could put on an orgy in my office and i wouldnt look up
well maybe once
to be able to concentrate for a considerable time is essential to difficult achievement
if there is anything that can be called genius it consists chiefly in the ability to give that attention to a subject which keeps it steadily in the mind till we have surveyed it accurately on all sides
if you dont concentrate youll end up on your rear
if i have ever made any valuable discoveries it has been owing more to patient attention than to any other talent
for him who has no concentration there is no tranquility
the secret to success in any human endeavor is total concentration
the secret of concentration is the secret of selfdiscovery
you reach inside yourself to discover your personal resources and what it takes to match them to the challenge
beware of dissipating your powers strive constantly to concentrate them
one arrow does not bring down two birds
no horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed
no steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined
no niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled
no life ever grows great until it is focused dedicated disciplined
a man may be so much of everything that he is nothing of everything
concentrate your energies your thoughts and your capital

the wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket
one man two loves
no good ever comes of that
one cannot both feast and become rich
the perplexity of life arises from there being too many interesting things in it for us to be interested properly in any of them
no country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time
the field of consciousness is tiny
it accepts only one problem at a time
to do two things at once is to do neither
i like to laugh but on the court it is my work
i try to smile but it is so difficult
i concentrate on the ball not on my face
successful minds work like a gimlet to a single point
a bird can roost but on one branch
a mouse can drink no more than its fill from a river
each man is capable of doing one thing well
if he attempts several he will fail to achieve distinction in any
this one thing i do
i press toward the mark
all good is gained by those whose thought and life are kept pointed close to one main thing not scattered abroad upon a thousand
the first law of success  is concentration to bend all the energies to one point and to go directly to that point looking neither to the right nor the left
give me a man who says this one thing i do and not these fifty things i dabble in
a single idea if it is right saves us the labor of an infinity of experiences
one thought driven home is better than three left on base
purity of heart is to will one thing
a man should remove not only unnecessary acts but also unnecessary thoughts for then superfluous activity will not follow
no man will swim ashore and take his baggage with him
many people who wonder why they dont amount to more than they do have good stuff in them and are energetic persevering and have ample opportunities
it is all a case of trimming the useless branches and throwing the whole force of power into the development of something that counts
a great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism and spends his energies upon that
while the work or play is on  dont constantly feel you ought to be doing the other
when one is learning one should not think of play and when one is at play one should not think of learning
the immature mind hops from one thing to another the mature mind seeks to follow through
if you want to hit a bird on the wing you must have all your will in focus you must not be thinking about yourself and equally you must not be thinking about your neighbor you must be living in your eye on that bird
every achievement is a bird on the wing
the difference in men does not lie in the size of their hands nor in the perfection of their bodies but in this one sublime ability of concentration to throw the weight with the blow to live an eternity in an hour
i go at what i am about as if there was nothing else in the world for the time being
choice of attention to pay attention to this and ignore that is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer
concentration is everything
on the day im performing i dont hear anything anyone says to me
the real essence of work is concentrated energy
you cant ring the bells and at the same time walk in the procession
ive learned ruthless concentration
i can write under any circumstances  street noises loud talk music you name it
do whatever you do intensely
the effectiveness of work increases according to geometrical progression if there are no interruptions
other peoples interruptions of your work are relatively insignificant compared with the countless times you interrupt yourself
if you direct your whole thought to work itself none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind
a full mind is an empty baseball bat
there is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time
if you direct your whole thought to work itself none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind
become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid
attention to a subject depends upon our interest in it
i cant concentrate on golf or bowling
those bowling pins arent going to hurt me
i can concentrate in the ring because someone is trying to kill me
when i come into a game in the bottom of the ninth bases loaded no one out and a onerun lead  it takes people off my mind
concentrate on finding your goal then concentrate on reaching it
those who set out to serve both god and mammon soon discover that there is no god
when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully
be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath
the integrity of men is to be measured by their conduct not by their professions
open confession is good for the soul
to confess a fault freely is the next thing to being innocent of it
the confidence which we have in ourselves gives birth to much of that which we have in others
society is built upon trust
be courteous to all but intimate with few and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence
every man in it is a great man an orator a critic a statesman and therefore every man upon every question must show his oratory his criticism and his political abilities
fleas can be taught nearly anything that a congressman can
some statesmen go to congress and some go to jail
it is the same thing after all
how grand is victory but how dear
he who surpasses or subdues mankind must look down on the hate of those below
i came i saw i conquered
to rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder
selfconquest is the greatest of victories
conscience is a motherinlaw whose visit never ends
conscience is a cur that will let you get past it but that you cannot keep from barking
conscience is but a word that cowards use devised at first to keep the strong in awe
conscience reigns but it does not govern
a mans vanity tells him what is honour a mans conscience what is justice
conscience does make cowards of us all
conscience is thoroughly wellbred and soon leaves off talking to those who do not wish to hear it
conscience is a coward and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to accuse
i feel bad that i dont feel worse
shame arises from the fear of man conscience from the fear of god
nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell the tortures of that inward hell
the only incorruptible thing about us
liberty of conscience when people have consciences is rightly considered the most indispensable of liberties
there is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience
conscience is a sacred sanctuary where god alone may enter as judge
i am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals
i have within me the great pope self
thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action
the soft whispers of the god in man
a statesman who is enamored of existing evils as distinquished from the liberal who wishes to replace them with others
we are reformers in spring and summer in autumn and winter we stand by the old reformers in the morning conservers at night
reform is affirmative conservatism negative conservatism goes for comfort reform for truth
a conservative is a man who will not look at the new moon out of respect for that ancient institution the old one
what is conservatism
is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried
inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent
nothing that is not a real crime makes a man appear so contemptible and little in the eyes of the world as inconsistency
like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing ones mind
a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines
with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do
he may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall
speak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict everything you said today
consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago
consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative
conservatism is the maintenance of conventions already in force
there are those who would misteach us that to stick in a rut is consistency  and a virtue and that to climb out of the rut is inconsistency  and a vice
people who honestly mean to be true really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be consistent
the only man who can change his mind is the man whos got one
a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines
inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent
shoemaker stick to your last
constitutions should consist only of general provisions the reason is that they must necessarily be permanent and that they cannot calculate for the possible change of things
we are under a constitution but the constitution is what the judges say it is
in questions of power let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution
a good constitution is infinitely better than the best despot
enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another
i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm
he is well paid that is well satisfied
it is not for man to rest in absolute contentment
no great advance has ever been made in science politics or religion without controversy
if a cause be good the most violent attack of its enemies will not injure it so much as an injudicious defense of it by its friends
conversation is the fine art of mutual consideration and communication about matters of common interest that basically have some human importance
great talkers are trying to fill the gap between themselves and others but only widen it
half the world is composed of people who have something to say and cant and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it
pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting
we allow them to disperse because we have been ignorant of their value
speech is civilization itself
the habit of common and continuous speech is a symptom of mental deficiency
it proceeds from not knowing what is going on in other peoples minds
the time to stop talking is when the other person nods his head affirmatively but says nothing
there is no such thing as conversation
it is an illusion
there are intersecting monologues
that is all
he was one of those men whose constitutional inability to make small talk forfeits all ones sympathy and makes one think that social grace is sometimes a moral duty
he macaulay has occasional flashes of silence that make his conversation perfectly delightful
as i got warmed up and felt perfectly at home in talk i heard myself boasting lying exaggerating
oh not deliberately far from it
it would be unconvivial and dull to stop and arrest the flow of talk and speak only after carefully considering whether i was telling the truth
men always talk about the most important things to perfect strangers
not a sentence or a word is independent of the circumstances under which it is uttered
communication is and should be hell fire and sparks as well as sweetness and light
the really important things are said over cocktails and are never done
you never say a word of yourself dear lady grey
you have that dreadful sin of antiegotism
the real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment
listen or thy tongue will keep thee deaf
people love to talk but hate to listen
listening is not merely not talking though even that is beyond most of our powers it means taking a vigorous human interest in what is being told us
you can listen like a blank wall or like a splendid auditorium where every sound comes back fuller and richer
a man who listens because he has nothing to say can hardly be a source of inspiration
the only listening that counts is that of the talker who alternately absorbs and expresses ideas
when i think over what i have said i envy dumb people
that is the happiest conversation where there is no competition no vanity but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments
john wesleys conversation is good but he is never at leisure
he is always obliged to go at a certain hour
this is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have his talk out as i do
she had lost the art of conversation but not unfortunately the power of speech
too much agreement kills a chat
you can never hope to become a skilled conversationalist until you learn how to put your foot tactfully through the television set
some persons talk simply because they think sound is more manageable than silence
while the right to talk may be the beginning of freedom the necessity of listening is what makes the right important
listening is a magnetic and strange thing a creative force
the friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward and we want to sit in their radius
when we are listened to it creates us makes us unfold and expand
a ceremony of selfwastage  good talkers are miserable they know that they have betrayed themselves that they have taken material which should have a life of its own to disperse it in noises upon the air
wit is the salt of conversation not the food
debate is masculine conversation is feminine
never hold any one by the button or the hand in order to be heard out for if people are unwilling to hear you you had better hold your tongue than them
conversation enriches the understanding but solitude is the school of genius
silence is one great art of conversation
conceit causes more conversation than wit
the less men think the more they talk
a conservative believes nothing should be done for the first time
now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
genuine blasphemy genuine in spirit and not purely verbal is the product of partial belief and is as impossible to the complete atheist as to the perfect christian
i believe in the gods
or rather i believe that i believe in the gods
but i dont believe that they are great brooding presences watching over us i believe they are completely absentminded
i think that a society cannot live without a certain number of irrational beliefs
they are protected from criticism and analysis because they are irrational
what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme but that they are intolerant
the evil is not what they say about their cause but what they say about their opponents
it is a perplexing and unpleasant truth that when men already have something worth fighting for they do not feel like fighting
martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity never of the correctness of a belief
belief is better than anything else and it is best when rapt  above paying its respects to anybodys doubt whatsoever
the peak of tolerance is most readily achieved by those who are not burdened with convictions
a belief is not merely an idea the mind possesses it is an idea that possesses the mind
every man who attacks my belief diminishes in some degree my confidence in it and therefore makes me uneasy and i am angry with him who makes me uneasy
penetrating so many secrets we cease to believe in the unknowable
but there it sits nevertheless calmly licking its chops
believe not your own brother  believe instead your own blind eye
whether you are really right or not doesnt matter its the belief that counts
i love an opposition that has convictions
every man wherever he goes is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions which move with him like flies on a summer day
convictions are the mainsprings of action the driving powers of life
what a man lives are his convictions
the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity
conviction is possible only in a world more primitive than ours can be perceived to be
a man can achieve a simply gnomic conviction only by ignoring the radical describers of his environment or by hating them as convinced men have hated say darwin and freud as agents of some devil
those who serve a cause are not those who love that cause
they are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it  except in the case of the very purest and they are rare
the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving
orthodoxy is my doxy  heterodoxy is another mans doxy
every dogma has its day
a man can believe in a considerable deal of rubbish and yet go about his daily work in a rational and cheerful manner
every life is a possession of faith and exercises an inevitable and silent propaganda
soon after a hard decision something inevitably occurs to cast doubt
holding steady against that doubt usually proves the decision
i may have faults but being wrong aint one of them
the discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star
we may live without friends we may live without books but civilized man cannot live without cooks
too many cooks spoil the broth
god sends meat and the devil sends cooks
the more corrupt the state the more laws
just for a handful of silver he left us just for a ribbon to stick in his coat
if the chief party whether it be the people or the army or the nobility which you think most useful and of most consequence to you for the conservation of your dignity be corrupt you must follow their humor and indulge them and in that case honesty and virtue are pernicious
i consider it the best part of an education to have been born and brought up in the country
the town is mans world but this country life is of god
in chinese the word for crisis is weiji composed of the character wei which means danger and ji which means opportunity
my advice to you if you should ever be in a hold up is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you
it is easy enough to praise men for the courage of their convictions
i wish i could teach the sad young of this mealy generation the courage of their confusions
it takes a kind of shabby arrogance to survive in our time and a fairly romantic nature to want to
growth demands a temporary surrender of security
life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage
no one provokes me with impunity nemo me impune lacessit
neither have they hearts to stay nor wit enough to run away
respectability the offspring of a liaison between a bald head and a bank account
until the day of his death no man can be sure of his courage
there is no such thing as bravery only degrees of fear
why not is a slogan for an interesting life
you dont learn to hold your own in the world by standing on guard but by attacking and getting well hammered yourself
here i stand
i can do no other
god help me
amen
many become brave when brought to bay
o god give us serenity to accept what cannot be changed courage to change what should be changed and wisdom to distinguish the one from the other
the first virtue in a soldier is endurance of fatigue courage is only the second virtue
courage is fear holding on a minute longer
we could be cowards if we had courage enough
showing up is eighty percent of life
a high station in life is earned by the gallantry with which appalling experiences are survived with grace
a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
the western world has lost its civic courage both as a whole and separately in each country in each government in each political party and of course in the united nations
such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression that the loss of courage extends to the entire society
courage is doing what youre afraid to do
there can be no courage unless youre scared
one man with courage makes a majority
if one is forever cautious can one remain a human being
never let your head hang down
never give up and sit down and grieve
find another way
and dont pray when it rains if you dont pray when the sun shines
the ancient mariner said to neptune during a great storm o god you will save me if you wish but i am going to go on holding my tiller straight
fight on my merry men all im a little wounded but i am not slain i will lay me down for to bleed a while then ill rise and fight with you again
the paradox of courage is that a man must be a little careless of his life even in order to keep it
the last thing a woman will consent to discover in a man whom she loves or on whom she simply depends is want of courage
please understand there is no depression in this house and we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat
they do not exist
now the trumpet summons us again  not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation a struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself
to be brave one short instant is no easy matter it is easier to die for a cause than to live for it
the courage we desire and prize is not the courage to die decently but to live manfully
have the courage to act instead of react

a moral sensible and wellbred man will not affront me and no other can
he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day
but he who is in battle slain can never rise to fight again
a cowardly act
what do i care about that
you may be sure that i should never fear to commit one if it were to my advantage
a cowardly cur barks more fiercely than it bites
all men would be cowards if they durst
one who in a perilous emergency thinks with his legs
personal liberty is the paramount essential to human dignity and human happiness
hereditary boundsmen
know ye not who would be free themselves must strike the blow
and freedom shrieked as kosciusko fell
in a free country there is much clamor with little suffering in a despotic state there is little complaint with much grievance
for what avail the plough or sail or land or life if freedom fail
ay call it holy ground the soil where first they trod they have left unstained what there they found   freedom to worship god
in the beauty of the lilies christ was born across the sea with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free while god is marching on
i am for freedom of religion and against all maneuvers to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect over another
and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it
that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom
since the general civilization of mankind i believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations
the only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it
we must be free or die who speak the tongue that shakespeare spake the faith and morals hold which milton held
no amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses
i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than to be crowded on a velvet cushion
i never saw a purple cow i never hope to see one but i can tell you anyhow id rather see than be one
there was an old man who said how shall i flee from this horrible cow
i will sit on this stile and continue to smile which may soften the heart of that cow
the reality is that changes are coming

they must come
you must share in bringing them
after youve done a thing the same way for two years look it over carefully
after five years look at it with suspicion
and after ten years throw it away and start all over
all that philosophers have done is interpret the world in different ways
it is our job to change it
christians are supposed not merely to endure change nor even to profit by it but to cause it
if you have no will to change it you have no right to criticize it
changes are not predictable but to deny them is to be an accomplice to ones own unnecessary vegetation
we must learn to view change as a natural phenomenonto anticipate it and to plan for it
the future is ours to channel in the direction we want to go  we must continually ask ourselves what will happen if

or better still how can we make it happen
one must change ones tactics every ten years if one wishes to maintain ones superiority
new things cannot come where there is no room
the important thing is this to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become
when patterns are broken new worlds emerge
one must lose ones life in order to find it
this mouse must give up one of his mouse ways of seeing things in order that he may grow
compromise if not the spice of life is its solidity
the only alternative to war is peace and the only road to peace is negotiations
every one should keep a mental wastepaper basket and the older he grows the more things he will consign to ittorn up to irrecoverable tatters
unless one says goodbye to what one loves and unless one travels to completely new territories one can expect merely a long wearing away of oneself and an eventual extinction
how does one become a butterfly
she asked pensively
you must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar
no matter how far you have gone on a wrong road turn back
duration is not a test of true or false
it is only an error in judgement to make a mistake but it shows infirmity of character to adhere to it when discovered
if you board the wrong train it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction
its never too latein fiction or in lifeto revise
any path is only a path and there is no affront to oneself or to others in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you
there is a time for departure even when theres no certain place to go
being stuck is a position few of us like
we want something new but cannot let go of the oldold ideas beliefs habits even thoughts
we are out of contact with our own genius
sometimes we know we are stuck sometimes we dont
in both cases we have to do something
my success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense
lose yourself wholly and the more you lose the more you will find
heroes take journeys confront dragons and discover the treasure of their true selves
lifes challenges are not supposed to paralyze you theyre supposed to help you discover who you are
just as we outgrow a pair of trousers we outgrow acquaintances libraries principles etc at times before theyre worn out and timesand this is the worst of allbefore we have new ones
it is best to learn as we go not go as we have learned
those interested in perpetuating present conditions are always in tears about the marvelous past that is about to disappear without having so much as a smile for the young future
i will not change just to court popularity
innovation
one cannot be forever innovating
i want to create classics
have no fear of change as such and on the other hand no liking for it merely for its own sake
if you want to stand out dont be different be outstanding
the main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything  or nothing
to change and to improve are two different things
our fathers valued change for the sake of its results we value it in the act
we must beware of needless innovations especially when guided by logic
all change is not growth as all movement is not forward
just because everything is different doesnt mean anything has changed
none are happy but by the anticipation of change
the change itself is nothing when we have made it the next wish is to change again
we accept the verdict of the past until the need for change cries out loudly enough to force upon us a choice between the comforts of further inertia and the irksomeness of action
to some will come a time when change itself is beauty if not heaven
today is not yesterday how can our works and thoughts if they are always to be the fittest continue always the same
change indeed is painful yet ever needful
security can only be achieved through constant change through discarding old ideas that have outlived their usefulness and adapting others to current facts
you had better be ready to change your mind when needed
loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul
they were so strong in their beliefs that there came a time when it hardly mattered what exactly those beliefs were they all fused into a single stubbornness
we are chameleons and our partialities and prejudices change place with an easy and blessed facility
our firmest convictions are apt to be the most suspect they mark our limitations and our bounds
life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries
it often takes more courage to change ones opinion than to stick to it
all our final resolutions are made in a state of mind which is not going to last
its an ill plan that cannot be changed
the death of dogma is the birth of reality
if anyone accuses me of contradicting myself i reply because i have been wrong once or oftener i do not aspire to be always wrong
he who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality
it is in the uncompromisingness with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or want of dogma that the danger lies
i wish to say what i think and feel today with the proviso that tomorrow perhaps i shall contradict it all
progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything
the most significant change in a persons life is a change of attitude
right attitudes produce right actions
you had better be ready to change your mind when needed or your mind will change you
the most fatal illusion is the settled point of view
since life is growth and motion a fixed point of view kills anybody who has one
the world does not have to change
the only thing that has to change is our attitude
oh would that my mind could let fall its dead ideas as the tree does its withered leaves
convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies
a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines
a man should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong which is but saying  that he is wiser today than yesterday
we have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood
it is well for people who think to change their minds occasionally in order to keep them clean
for those who do not think it is best at least to rearrange their prejudices once in a while
new opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common
do i contradict myself
very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes
i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be new views
contradiction is not a sign of falsity nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth
my opinion is a view i hold until well until i find something that changes it
he that never changes his opinions and never corrects his mistakes will never be wiser on the morrow than he is today
inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent
there is nothing in this world constant but inconstancy
consistency is only suitable for ridicule
the world is quite right
it does not have to be consistent
the worlds a scene of changes and to be constant in nature is inconstancy
we cannot remain consistent with the world save by growing inconsistent with our past selves
consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative
the world is quite right
it does not have to be consistent
true consistency that of the prudent and the wise is to act in conformity with circumstances and not to act always the same way under a change of circumstances
consistency is a paste jewel that only cheap men cherish
consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago
consistency is contrary to nature contrary to life
the only completely consistent people are the dead
there are those who would misteach us that to stick in a rut is consistency and a virtue and that to climb out of the rut is inconsistency and a vice
too much consistency is as bad for the mind as for the body
with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do

speak what you think today in words as hard as cannon balls and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradicts everything you said today
people who honestly mean to be true really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be consistent
to be honest one must be inconsistent
the only man who cant change his mind is a man who hasnt got one
like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing ones mind
nothing should be permanent except struggle with the dark side within ourselves
the foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion
a fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject
the circumstances of the world are so variable that an irrevocable purpose or opinion is almost synonymous with a foolish one
if in the last few years you havent discarded a major opinion or acquired a new one check your pulse
you may be dead
a stiff attitude is one of the phenomena of rigor mortis
those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth
its the most unhappy people who most fear change
obstinacy and heat in sticking to ones opinions is the surest proof of stupidity
is there anything so cocksure so immovable so disdainful so contemplative so solemn and serious as an ass
the man who never alters his opinion is like standing water and breeds reptiles of the mind
when people are least sure they are often most dogmatic
a conclusion is a place where you got tired of thinking
only fools and dead men dont change their minds
fools wont
dead men cant
the consistent thinker  is either a walking mummy or else if he has not succeeded in stifling all his vitality a fanatical monomaniac
life is not a static thing
the only people who do not change their minds are incompetents in asylums and those in cemeteries
to hold the same views at forty as we held at twenty is to have been stupefied for a score of years and to take rank not as a prophet but as an unteachable brat well birched and none the wiser
to do things today exactly the way you did them yesterday saves thinking
any change even a change for the better is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts
old habits are strong and jealous
every new adjustment is a crisis in selfesteem
every new truth begins in a shocking heresy
birth is violent whether it be the birth of a child or the birth of an idea
any truth creates a scandal
even in slight things the experience of the new is rarely without some stirring of foreboding
change is not made without inconvenience even from worse to better
all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter into another
the key to change  is to let go of fear
tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death
when a life has been lived completely honestly completely successfully or just completely the correct response to deaths perfect punctuation mark is a smile
since changes are going on anyway the great thing is to learn enough about them so that we will be able to lay hold of them and turn them in the direction of our desires
conditions and events are neither to be fled from nor passively acquiesced in they are to be utilized and directed
he that has energy enough to root out a vice should go further and try to plant a virtue in its place
to change skins evolve into new cycles i feel one has to learn to discard
if one changes internally one should not continue to live with the same objects
they reflect ones mind and psyche of yesterday
i throw away what has no dynamic living use
today changes must come fast and we must adjust our mental habits so that we can accept comfortably the idea of stopping one thing and beginning another overnight we must assume that there is probably a better way to do almost everything
we must stop assuming that a thing which has never been done before probably cannot be done at all
we must therefore take account of this changeable nature of things and of human institutions and prepare for them with enlightened foresight
you dont have to be afraid of change
you dont have to worry about whats being taken away
just look to see whats been added
when youre stuck in a spiral to change all aspects of the spin you need only to change one thing
the first step toward change is acceptance
once you accept yourself you open the door to change
thats all you have to do
change is not something you do its something you allow
the more things change the more they remain the same
things good in themselves  perfectly valid in the integrity of their origins become fetters if they cannot alter
change lays her hand not upon the truth
the spectacle has changed but our eyes remain the same
change is the constant the signal for rebirth the egg of the phoenix
change is what people fear most
change means the unknown
natures mighty law is change
a human being does not cease to exist at death
it is change not destruction which takes place
the old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfills himself in many ways

one persons constant is another persons variable
the mill wheel turns it turns forever though what is uppermost remains not so
its a bad plan that cant be changed
in a way winter is the real spring the time when the inner things happen the resurge of nature
mourning is not forgetting

it is an undoing
every minute tie has to be untied and something permanent and valuable recovered and assimilated from the dust
it is never any good dwelling on goodbyes
it is not the being together that it prolongs it is the parting
such is the state of life that none are happy but by the anticipation of change
the change itself is nothing
when we have made it the next wish is to change again
new links must be forged as old ones rust
the hearts of great men can be changed
you cannot step twice into the same river for other waters are continually flowing on
a mans fortune must first be changed from within
one change always leaves the way open for the establishment of others
there is danger in reckless change but greater danger in blind conservatism
without imagination nothing is dangerous
everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change
the moment of change is the only poem
i have accepted fear as a part of lifespecifically the fear of change

i have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

as we learn we always change and so our perception
this changed perception then becomes a new teacher inside each of us
we are restless because of incessant change but we would be frightened if change were stopped
one must be thrust out of a finished cycle in life and that leap is the most difficult to maketo part with ones faith ones love when one would prefer to renew the faith and recreate the passion
when one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us
if you want to make enemies try to change something
god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference

musical comedies arent written they are rewritten
i see the playwright as a lay preacher peddling the ideas of his time in popular form
the art of creation is older than the art of killing
human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted
in the creative state a man is taken out of himself
he lets down as it were a bucket into his subconscious and draws up something which is normally beyond his reach
he mixes this thing with his normal experiences and out of the mixture he makes a work of art
i do not seek
i find
the creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn
the life of the creative man is led directed and controlled by boredom
avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes
an artist is a creature driven by demons
he doesnt know why they choose him and hes usually too busy to wonder why

it is just that others are behind the time

in creating the only hard things to begin a grassblades no easier to make than an oak
i can always be distracted by love but eventually i get horny for my creativity
the end of every maker is himself

undetected plagiarism
originality is nothing but judicious imitation
a hunch is creativity trying to tell you something
style is a simple way of saying complicated things
what another would have done as well as you do not do it
what another would have said as well as you do not say it
what another would have written as well do not write it
be faithful to that which exists nowhere but in yourself and thus make yourself indispensable
it seems that the creative faculty and the critical faculty cannot exist together in their highest perfection
i must create a system or be enslaved by another mans
i will not reason and compare my business is to create
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep
and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
nature they say doth dote and cannot make a man save on some wornout plan repeating us by rote
all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul
it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it
the world embarrasses me and i cannot dream that this watch exists and has no watchmaker
god is in the world or nowhere creating continually in us and around us
insofar as man partakes of this creative process does he partake of the divine of god and that participation is his immortality

there is no greater joy than that of feeling oneself a creator
the triumph of life is expressed by creation
creativity is a central source of meaning in our lives


most of the things that are interesting important and human are the results of creativity

a hunch is creativity trying to tell you something
i saw an angel in the block of marble and i just chiseled til i set him free
in creating the only hard things to begin a grassblades no easier to make than an oak
no matter how old you get if you can keep the desire to be creative youre keeping the manchild alive
it is the child in man that is the source of his uniqueness and creativeness and the playground is the optimal milieu for the unfolding of his capacities
many times we will get more ideas and better ideas in two hours of creative loafing than in eight hours at a desk
if you are seeking creative ideas go out walking
angels whisper to a man when he goes for a walk
in god we trust all others must pay cash
he that hath lost his credit is dead to the world
no mans credit is as good as his money
ah take the cash and let the credit go

the study of crime begins with the knowledge of oneself
fear succeeds crime  it is its punishment

speaking generally punishment hardens and numbs it produces concentration it sharpens the consciousness of alienation it strengthens the power of resistance
he only may chastise who loves
if england treats her criminals the way she has treated me she doesnt deserve to have any
it is fairly obvious that those who are in favour of the death penalty have more affinity with assassins than those who are not
prisons dont rehabilitate they dont punish they dont protect so what the hell do they do
capital punishment is as fundamentally wrong as a cure for crime as charity is wrong as a cure for poverty
the reformative effect of punishment is a belief that dies hard chiefly i think because it is so satisfying to our sadistic impulses
much as he is opposed to lawbreaking he is not bigoted about it
crime like virtue has its degrees
society prepares the crime the criminal commits it
many commit the same crimes with a very different result
one bears a cross for his crime another a crown
one crime is everything two nothing
whoever profits by the crime is guilty of it
it is not the thief who is hanged but one who was caught stealing
we enact many laws that manufacture criminals and then a few that punish them
yet each man kills the thing he loves by each let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword
when written in chinese the word crisis is composed of two characters
one represents danger and the other represents opportunity
any idiot can face a crisis  its this daytoday living that wears you out
every new adjustment is a crisis in selfesteem
winston has written four volumes about himself and called it world crisis
poetry is the language of a state of crisis
there cannot be a crisis next week
my schedule is already full
there is no crisis to which academics will not respond with a seminar
faced with crisis the man of character falls back on himself
the crisis of today is the joke of tomorrow
the crisis you have to worry about most is the one you dont see coming
so when the crisis is upon you remember that god like a trainer of wrestlers has matched you with a tough and stalwart antagonist that you may prove a victor at the great games
said the pot to die kettle get away blackface
critics are the men who have failed in literature and art
as a bankrupt thief turns thieftaker in despair so an unsuccessful author turns critic
what a blessed thing it is that nature when she invented manufactured and patented her audiors contrived to make critics out of the chips that were left
even the lion has to defend himself against flies
i had rather be hissed for a good verse than applauded for a bad one
of all the cants which are canted in this canting world   though the cant of hypocrites ihay be the worst  the cant of criticism is the most tormenting
a guest sees more in an hour than the host in a year
asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a lamppost how it feels about dogs
book reviewers are little old ladies of both sexes
constant indiscriminate approval devalues because it is so predictable
critics are biased and so are readers
indeed a critic is a bundle of biases held loosely together by a sense of taste
but intelligent readers soon discover how to allow for the windage of their own and a critics prejudices
dont judge any man until you have walked two moons in his moccasins
henry james chews more than he bites off
i dont want to see the uncut version of anything

two and two continue to make four in spite of the whine of the amateur for three or the cry of the critic for five
tomorrow night i appear for the first time before a boston audience  4000 critics
he has a right to criticize who has a heart to help
more and more people think of the critic as an indispensable middle man between writer and reader and would no more read a book alone if they could help it than have a baby alone
it is not expected of critics that they should help us to make sense of our lives they are bound only to attempt the lesser feat of making sense of the ways we try to make sense of our lives
analysis kills spontaneity
the grain once ground into flour springs and germinates no more
his words leap across rivers and mountains but his thoughts are still only six inches long
when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself
the factor in human life provocative of a noble discontent is the gradual emergence of a sense of criticism founded upon appreciation of beauty and of intellectual distinction and of duty
to many people dramatic criticism must seem like an attempt to tattoo soap bubbles
the test of a good critic is whether he knows when and how to believe on insufficient evidence
reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee
in judging others folks will work overtime for no pay
a critic is a man who knows the way but cant drive the car
if you are willing to take the punishment youre halfway through the battle
that the issues may be trivial the battle ugly is another point

vilify
some of it will always stick
always bring money along with your complaints
nature fits all her children with something to do he who would write and cant write can surely review
nature when she invented manufactured and patented her authors contrived to make critics out of the chips that were left

critics are like eunuchs in a harem they know how its done theyve seen it done every day but theyre unable to do it themselves
i am sitting in the smallest room in my house
i have your review in front of me
soon it will be behind me
the good critic is he who narrates the adventures of his soul among masterpieces
of all the cants which are canted in this canting world tho the cant of hypocrites may be the worst the cant of criticism is the most tormenting

the mob has many heads but no brains
a myth is a fixed way of looking at the world which cannot be destroyed because looked at through the myth all evidence supports that myth
insanity in individuals is rare  but in groups parties nations and epochs it is the rule
every crowd has a silver lining
when a hundred men stand together each of them loses his mind and gets another one
wherever there is a crowd there is untruth
the time when most of all you should withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd
you cannot make a man by standing a sheep on its hind legs
but by standing a flock of sheep in that position you can make a crowd of men

a cynic is not merely one who reads bitter lessons from the past he is one who is prematurely disappointed in the future
cynicism is humour in ill health
cynicism such as one finds very frequently among the most highly educated young men and women of the west results from the combination of comfort and powerlessness
a cynic is a man who when he smells flowers looks around for a coffin
cynicism  the intellectual cripples substitute for intelligence
cynicism is that blackguard defect of vision which compels us to see the world as it is instead of as it should be
cynicism is intellectual dandyism without the coxcombs feathers
there is nothing to which men while they have food and drink cannot reconcile themselves
its not that the irish are cynical
its rather that they have a wonderful lack of respect for everything and everybody
watch what people are cynical about and one can often discover what they lack
what is a cynic
a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
a cynic can chill and dishearten with a single word
we can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusion just as effectively as by bombs
cynicism is an unpleasant way of saying the truth
a cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
the cynic is one who never sees a good quality in a man and never fails to see a bad one
he is the human owl vigilant in darkness and blind to light mousing for vermin and never seeing noble game
the cynic puts all human actions into two classes  openly bad and secretly bad
on with the dance
let joy be unconfind no sleep till morn when youth and pleasure meet
no man in his senses will dance
come and trip it as ye go on the light fantastic toe
they who love dancing too much seem to have more brains in their feet than in their head
we triumph without glory when we conquer without danger
danger for dangers sake is senseless
the pitcher that goes too often to the well is broken at last
a timid person is frightened before a danger a coward during the time and a courageous person afterwards
who dares nothing need hope for nothing
no one reaches a high position without daring
when it is dark enough you can see the stars

it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
flowers grow out of dark moments
the dreadful dead of dark midnight
when it is dark enough you can see the stars
a blind man in a dark room  looking for a black hat which isnt there
darkness is strong and so is sin but surely god endures forever
fear is the dark room in which negatives are developed
even a small star shines in the darkness
it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
flowers grow out of dark moments
the dreadful dead of dark midnight
when it is dark enough you can see the stars
a blind man in a dark room  looking for a black hat which isnt there
darkness is strong and so is sin but surely god endures forever
fear is the dark room in which negatives are developed
even a small star shines in the darkness
it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
flowers grow out of dark moments
the dreadful dead of dark midnight
it is always darkest just before the day dawneth

human life consists in mutual service
no grief pain misfortune or broken heart is excuse for cutting off ones life while any power of service remains
but when all usefulness is over when one is assured of an unavoidable and imminent death it is the simplest of human rights to choose a quick and easy death in place of a slow and horrible one

men use one another to assure their personal victory over death
any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
a belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumour and survival a thing not beyond the bounds of possibility

why fear death
it is the most beautiful adventure in life
now i am about to take my last voyage a great leap in the dark

strange  is it not
that of the myriads who before us passed the door of darkness through not one returns to tell us of the road which to discover we must travel too
i am dying egypt dying
yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
i have a rendezvous with death at some disputed barricade
till tired he sleeps and lifes poor play is oer
to die  to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field

everything that deceives may be said to enchant
we are never deceived we deceive ourselves
all charming people have something to conceal usually their total dependence on the appreciation of others
you kn hide de fier but what you guine do wid de smoke
deep versed in books and shallow in himself
half the work that is done in the world is to make things appear what they are not
what we need is a rebirth of satire of dissent of irreverence of an uncompromising insistence that phoniness is phony and platitudes are platitudinous
if the world will be gulled let it be gulled
i give you bitter pills in sugar coating
the pills are harmless the poison is in the sugar
i have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face
dont trust that conventional idea
dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance any day in the week if there is anything to be got by it
one should seek for the salutary in the unpleasant if it is there it is after all nectar
one should seek for the deceitful in the pleasant if it is there it is after all poison
deceive not thy physician confessor nor lawyer
frank and explicit  this is the right line to take when you wish to conceal your own mind and to confuse the mind of others
a delusion a mockery and a snare
we are never deceived we deceive ourselves
which i wish to remark    and my language is plain   that for ways that are dark and for tricks that are vain the heathen chinese is peculiar
hateful to me as are the gates of hell is he who hiding one thing in his heart utters another

it is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver
will you walk into my parlour
said the spider to a fly tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy
one is easily fooled by that which one loves
men and women everywhere must exercise deliberate selection to live wisely
decision and determination are the engineer and fireman of our train to opportunity and success
the last of the human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
choice of attention  is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer
in both cases a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences whatever they may be
you are the one who must choose your place
man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be what he will become in the next moment
full maturity  is achieved by realizing that you have choices to make
wherever you see a successful business someone once made a courageous decision
life is just a series of trying to make up your mind
life is just an endless chain of judgements



the more imperfect our judgement the less perfect our success
to know just what has do be done then to do it comprises the whole philosophy of practical life
life is like a game of cards
the hand that is dealt you represents determinism the way you play it is free will
somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision
living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
life is the sum of all your choices
life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises
the difficulty of life is in the choice
the strongest principle of growth lies in human choice
as a man thinketh so is he and as a man chooseth so is he
decisions determine destiny
choices are the hinges of destiny
many of lifes circumstances are created by three basic choices the disciplines you choose to keep the people you chose to be with and the laws you choose to obey
you dont get to choose how youre going to die
or when
you can only decide how youre going to live
now
look for your choices pick the best one then go with it
rules of society are nothing ones conscience is the umpire
no matter how lovesick a woman is she shouldnt take the first pill that comes along
form the habit of making decisions when your spirit is fresh  to let dark moods lead is like choosing cowards to command armies
one must either accept some theory or else believe ones own instinct or follow the worlds opinion
decide which is the line of conduct that presents the fewest drawbacks and then follow it out as being the best one because one never finds anything perfectly pure and unmixed or exempt from danger
a problem clearly stated is a problem half solved
we must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves
choose always the way that seems the best however rough it may be custom will soon render it easy and agreeable
where an opinion is general it is usually correct
in forty hours i shall be in battle with little information and on the spur of the moment will have to make the most momentous decisions
but i believe that ones spirit enlarges with responsibility and that with gods help i shall make them and make them right
once the what is decided the how always follows
we must not make the how an excuse for not facing and accepting the what
in each action we must look beyond the action at our past present and future state and at others whom it affects and see the relation of all those things
and then we shall be very cautious
ones mind has a way of making itself up in the background and it suddenly becomes clear what one means to do
not all of your decisions will be correct
none of us is perfect
but if you get into the habit of making decisions experience will develop your judgment to a point where more and more of your decisions will be right
after all it is better to be right 51 percent of the time and get something done than it is to get nothing done because you fear to reach a decision
decide on what you think is right and stick to it
continually one faces the horrible matter of making decisions
the solution  is as far as possible to avoid conscious rational decisions and choices simply to do what you find yourself doing to float in the great current of life with as little friction as possible to allow things to settle themselves as indeed they do with the most infallible certainty
when making a decision of minor importance i have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons
in vital matters however such as the choice of a mate or a profession the decision should come from the unconscious from somewhere within ourselves
in the important decisions of personal life we should be governed i think by the deep inner needs of our nature
pick battles big enough to matter small enough to win
wisdom consists in being able to distinguish among dangers and make a choice of the least harmful
i think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk
human foresight often leaves its proudest possessor only a choice of evils
when one bases his life on principle 99 percent of his decisions are already made
the best we can do is size up the chances calculate the risks involved estimate our ability to deal with them and then make our plans with confidence
in case of doubt decide in favor of what is correct
each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong which course is patriotic and which isnt
you cannot shirk this and be a man
to decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor both to yourself and to your country let men label you as they may
people died all the time
parts of them died when they made the wrong kinds of decisionsdecisions against life
sometimes they died bit by bit until finally they were just living corpses walking around
if you were perceptive you could see it in their eyes the fire had gone out  you always knew when you made a decision against life

the door clicked and you were safe inside safe and dead
what i emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment
we lose the fear of making decisions great and small as we realize that should our choice prove wrong we can if we will learn from the experience
history is a stern judge
i get a little angry about this highhanded scrapping of the look of things
what else have we to go by
how else can the average person form an opinion of a girls sense of values or even of her chastity except by the looks of her conduct
you wouldnt want to be caught wearing cheap perfume would you
then why do you want to wear cheap perfume on your conduct
the difference between weakness and wickedness is much less than people suppose and the consequences are nearly always the same
authority without wisdom is like a heavy axe without an edge fitter to bruise than to polish
one faces the future with ones past
our deeds still travel with us from afar and what we have been makes us what we are
you must not change one thing one pebble one grain of sand until you know what good and evil will follow on that act
the beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life
the pilgrims didnt have any experience when they landed here
hell if experience was that important wed never have anybody walking on the moon
each person has a literature inside them
but when people lose language when they have to experiment with putting their thoughts together on the spotthats what i love most
thats where character lives
there is no data on the future
the most important fact about spaceship earth an instruction book didnt come with it
life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation and without being allowed the preliminary trials the failures and botches that are essential for the training of a mere beginner
time has told me less than i need to know
i learn by going where i have to go
life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on
we dont have enough time to premeditate all our actions
every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge
faith  acts promptly and boldly on the occasion on slender evidence
a decision is an action you must take when you have information so incomplete that the answer does not suggest itself
she knew in her heart that to be without optimism that core of reasonless hope in the spirit rather than the brain was a fatal flaw the seed of death
when faith is supported by facts or by logic it ceases to be faith
how far would moses have gone if he had taken a poll in egypt
better to be without logic than without feeling
the will to be totally rational is the will to be made out of glass and steel and to use others as if they were glass and steel
in the three years i played ball we won six lost seventeen and tied two
some statistician  calculated that we won 75 percent of the games we didnt lose
imagination took the reins and reason slowpaced though surefooted was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion
many persons of high intelligence have notoriously poor judgement
how dangerous can false reasoning prove
the tendency of modern science is to reduce proof to absurdity by continually reducing absurdity to proof
say you were standing with one foot in the oven and one foot in an ice bucket
according to the percentage people you would be perfectly comfortable
logic is the art of going wrong with confidence
reason with most people means their own opinions
logic pervades the world the limits of the world are also the limits of logic
man is a reasoning rather than a reasonable animal
false conclusions which have been reasoned out are infinitely worse than blind impulse
if you do everything you should do and do not do anything you should not do you will according to the best available statistics live exactly eighteen hours longer than you would otherwise
decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because i know that i will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me i should do
statistics are no substitute for judgement
it is the heart always that sees before the head can see
facts are stubborn things but statistics are more pliable
a true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the result of sudden impulse and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast
it is always thus impaled by a state of mind which is destined not to last that we make our irrevocable decisions
a power greater than any human being helped make this decision
he who reflects too much will achieve little
the opportunity is often lost by deliberating
the percentage of mistakes in quick decisions is no greater than in longdrawnout vacillations and the effect of decisiveness itself makes things go and creates confidence
deliberation often loses a good chance
the mania of thinking renders one unfit for every activity
when possible make the decisions now even if action is in the future
a revised decision usually is better than one reached at the last moment
we spend our days in deliberating and we end them without coming to any resolve
if you think too long you think wrong
you decide youll wait for your pitch
then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance
and then you think about your swing
and then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch
the soul of dispatch is decision
the moment a question comes to your mind see yourself mentally taking hold of it and disposing of it
in that moment you learn to become the decider and not the vacillator
thus you build character
so what do we do
anything
something
so long as we just dont sit there
if we screw it up start over
try something else
if we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late
often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision
some persons are very decisive when it comes to avoiding decisions
do not wait for ideal circumstances nor the best opportunities they will never come
there comes a time when youve got to say lets get off our asses and go  i have always found that if i move with 75 percent or more of the facts i usually never regret it
its the guys who wait to have everything perfect that drive you crazy
conditions are never just right
people who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing
common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard but takes the one before it and plays the game
he who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses
if you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street
nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome
it is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them
the weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves
alternatives and particularly desirable alternatives grow only on imaginary trees
the more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones own appreciation of fundamental things like home and love and understanding companionship
our danger is not too few but too many options  to be puzzled by innumerable alternatives
the absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously
i couldnt claim that i have never felt the urge to explore evil but when you descend into hell you have to be very careful
if decisions were a choice between alternatives decisions would come easy
decision is the selection and formulation of alternatives
you cannot have your cake and eat it
it is better to arm and strengthen your hero than to disarm and enfeeble your foe
you cannot sell the cow and sup the milk
there is only one answer to destructiveness and that is creativity
a door must either be shut or open
heres a rule i recommend
never practice two vices at once
you cannot serve god and mammon
between two stools one sits on the ground
when you cannot make up your mind between two evenly balanced courses of action choose the bolder
when confronted with two courses of action i jot down on a piece of paper all the arguments in favor of each one then on the opposite side i write the arguments against each one
then by weighing the arguments pro and con and cancelling them out one against the other i take the course indicated by what remains
there are two ways of spreading light to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it
you cannot have it both ways
i would sort out all the arguments and see which belonged to fear and which to creativeness
other things being equal i would make the decision which had the larger number of creative reasons on its side
of two evils choose the less
of two evils choose the prettier
where bads the best bad must be the choice
both choices are painful but only one is therapeutic
god offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose
take which you pleaseyou can never have both
necessity relieves us from the embarrassment of choice
when you have to make a choice and dont make it that is in itself a choice
a man without decision can never be said to belong to himself he is as a wave of the sea or a feather in the air which every breeze blows about
nothing is so exhausting as indecision and nothing is so futile
not to decide is to decide
decision is a sharp knife that cuts clean and straight indecision a dull one that hacks and tears and leaves ragged edges behind it
there is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision
in not making the decision youve made one
not doing something is the same as doing it
there is a time when we must firmly choose the course we will follow or the relentless drift of events will make the decision for us
you can only predict things after theyve happened
it is the mark of a good action that it appears inevitable in retrospect
no one knows what he can to do until he tries
of all paths a man could strike into there is at any given moment a best path which here and now it were of all things wisest for him to do
to find this path and walk in it is the one thing needful for him
decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because i know that i will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me i should do
after a battle is over people talk a lot about how decisions were methodically reached but actually theres always a hell of a lot of groping around
no question is ever settled until it is settled right
no man who has not sat in the assemblies of men can know the light odd and uncertain ways in which decisions are often arrived at
no trumpets sound when the important decisions of our life are made
destiny is made known silently
a man must be able to cut a knot for everything cannot be untied
once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide  and the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light
necessity is not an established fact but an interpretation
we are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny
but what we put into it is ours
there is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice because all you have staked will be lost if you look back
lifes point of no return
optimism is an intellectual choice
the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one  the more active and swift the latter is the further he will go astray
nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able to decide
there is one quality more important than knowhow
this is knowhow by which we determine not only how to accomplish our purposes but what our purposes are to be
destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved
what must be shall be and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing
a wiser rule would be to make up your mind soberly what you want peace or war and then to get ready for what you want for what we prepare for is what we shall get
we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
once a decision was made i did not worry about it afterward
no country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time
the last if not the greatest of the human freedoms to choose their own attitude in any given circumstance
he who has a choice has trouble
we have left undone those things which we ought to have done and we have done those things which we ought not to have done
little deeds of kindness little words of love make our earth an eden like the heaven above
whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well
give me the ready hand rather than the ready tongue
noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed
heaven neer helps the man who will not help himself
do not be afraid of defeat
you are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause
to lose is to learn
we have fought this fight as long and as well as we know how
we have been defeated
for us as a christian people there is now but one course to pursue
we must accept the situation
i let the american people down and i have to carry that burden for the rest of my life
my political life is over
i will never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position
maybe i can give a little advice from time to time
what is defeat
nothing but education nothing but the first step toward something better
who apart from ourselves can see any difference between our victories and our defeats
they were never defeated they were only killed
the mountain remains unmoved at seeming defeat by the mist
it is defeat that turns bone to flint it is defeat that turns gristle to muscle it is defeat that makes men invincible
what is defeat
nothing but education nothing but the first step to something better
defeat should never be a source of discouragement but rather a fresh stimulus
demagogues and agitators are very unpleasant but they are incidents to a free and constitutional country and you must put up with these inconveniences or do without many important advantages
in every age the vilest specimens of human nature are to be found among demagogues
every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them
a wise fellow who is also worthless always charms the rabble
democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people
in a democracy the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional but must be maintained because it is indispensable
it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time
democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice
if you want to understand democracy spend less time in the library with plato and more time in the buses with people
democracy is a small hard core of common agreement surrounded by a rich variety of individual differences
people often say that in a democracy decisions are made by a majority of the people
of course that is not true
decisions are made by a majority of those who make themselves heard and who vote  a very different thing
democracy means government by the uneducated while aristocracy means government by the badly educated
my definition of a free society is a society where it is safe to be unpopular
it is the greatest good to the greatest number which is the measure of right and wrong
the greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom
but in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves
democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time
the worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal
what men value in the world is not rights but privileges
as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master
this expresses my idea of democracy
democracy is a festival of mediocrity
the job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open
it would be folly to argue that the people cannot make political mistakes
they can and do make grave mistakes
they know it they pay the penalty but compared with the mistakes which have been made by every kind of autocracy they are unimportant
democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people
the world must be made safe for democracy
democracy is the government of the people by the people for the people
democracy means not i am as good as you are but you are as good as i am
all the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy
i believe in democracy because it releases the energies of every human being
while democracy must have its organization and controls its vital breath is individual liberty
people may live as much retired from the world as they please but sooner or later before they are aware they will find themselves debtor or creditor to somebody
he who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken
it is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it
there are two tragedies in life
one is not to get your hearts desire
the other is to get it
our desires always increase with our possessions
the knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us
he who desires naught will always be free
ah love
could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we shatter it to bits  and then remold it nearer to the hearts desire
ail hope abandon ye who enter here
despair is the conclusion of fools
despair doubles our strength
it is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order
despotism can no more exist in a nation until the liberty of the press be destroyed than the night can happen before the sun is set
i will believe in the right of one man to govern a nation despotically when i find a man born unto the world with boots and spurs and a nation with saddles on their backs
we are but as the instrument of heaven
our work is not design but destiny
every man meets his waterloo at last
there is a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will
here is the devilandall to pay
resist the devil and he will flee from you
the devil was sick the devil a monk would be the devil was well the devil a monk was he
how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning
get thee behind me satan
he will give the devil his due
the prince of darkness is a gentleman
the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
everyone gets their rough day
no one gets a free ride
today so far i had a good day
i got a dial tone
thy fate is the common fate of all into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and dreary
some days you tame the tiger
and some days the tiger has you for lunch
some days the dragon wins
the one law that does not change is that everything changes and the hardship i was bearing today was only a breath away from the pleasures i would have tomorrow and those pleasures would be all the richer because of the memories of this i was enduring
experience cold or heat pleasure or pain
these experiences are fleeting they come and go
bear them patiently
to everything there is a season a time for every purpose under heaven a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
let nothing disturb thee let nothing affright thee all things are passing god changeth never
this too shall pass
the present will not long endure
we do not live an equal life but one of contrasts and patchwork now a little joy then a sorrow now a sin then a generous or brave action
i feel successful when the writing goes well
this lasts five minutes
once when i was number one on the bestseller list i also felt successful
that lasted three minutes
sadness and gladness succeed each other
sadness flies away on the wings of time
i dont think that  one gets a flash of happiness once and never again it is there within you and it will come as certainly as death
life comes in clusters clusters of solitude then clusters when there is hardly time to breathe
if winter comes can spring be far behind
human misery must somewhere have a stop there is no wind that always blows a storm
no winter lasts forever no spring skips its turn
there are trees that seem to die at the end of autumn
there are also the evergreens
our lord has written the promise of resurrection not in books alone but in every leaf in springtime
for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth
if matters go badly now they will not always be so
pain is never permanent
you will suffer and you will hurt
you will have joy and you will have peace
pain is part of being alive and we need to learn that
pain does not last forever nor is it necessarily unbearable and we need to be taught that
pain is hard to bear
but with patience day by day even this shall pass away
everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change
so suffering must become love
that is the mystery
ive been failing for like ten or eleven years
when it turns itll turn
right now im just tryin to squeeze through a very tight financial period get the movie out and put my things in order
ive never been poor only broke
being poor is a frame of mind
being broke is a temporary situation
in the darkest hour the soul is replenished and given strength to continue and endure
he that cant endure the bad will not live to see the good
our toil is sweet with thankfulness our burden is our boon the curse of earths gray morning is the blessing of its noon
were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches perhaps we would endure our sadnesses with greater confidence than our joys
for they are moments when something new has entered into us something unknown
we may draw good outof evil we must not do evil that good may come
you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles
what we call the beginning is often an end
and to make an end is to make a beginning
the end is where we start from
when one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us
death is a door life opens
the world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning
perhaps someday it will be pleasant to remember even this
one day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful
the crisis of today is the joke of tomorrow
sadness flies away on the wings of time
sometimes i found that in my happy moments i could not believe that i had ever been miserable
if our education had included training to bear unpleasantness and to let the first shock pass until we could think more calmly many an unbearable situation would become manageable and many a nervous illness avoided
there is a proverb expressing this
it says trouble is a tunnel through which we pass and not a brick wall against which we must break our head
time in the turningover of days works change for better or worse
experience is what really happens to you in the long run the truth that finally overtakes you
time is like a river of fleeting events and its current is strong as soon as something comes into sight it is swept past us and something else takes its place and that too will be swept away
time cools time clarifies no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours
time bears away all things
come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day
time brings all things to pass
we undo ourselves by impatience
misfortunes have their life and their limits their sickness and their health
the future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is
thats the advantage of having lived sixtyfive years
you dont feel the need to be impatient any longer
who longest waits most surely wins
patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruit
no emergency excuses you from exercising tolerance
i believe the sign of maturity is accepting deferred gratification
he that can have patience can have what he will
being human we should bear all we can
adopt the pace of nature her secret is patience
you cant have genius without patience
the most potent and sacred command which can be laid upon any artist is the command wait
how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
all things come round to him who will but wait
panic is not an effective longterm organizing strategy
selfdenial is painful for a moment but very agreeable in the end
and he shall reign a goodly king and sway his hand oer every clime with peace writ on his signet ring who bides his time
it takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward of taking time to do anything well
patience and fortitude conquer all things
be not afraid of growing slowly be afraid only of standing still
wisely and slow
they stumble that run fast
no great thing is created suddenly any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig
if you tell me that you desire a fig i answer you that there must be time
let it first blossom then bear fruit then ripen
time deals gently only with those who take it gently
hold on hold fast hold out
patience is genius
genius is nothing but a greater aptitude for patience
all human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope
genius is eternal patience
serene i fold my hands and wait
the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong
everything comes if a man will only wait
everything comes to him who hustles while he waits
the secret of patience  to do something else in the meantime
have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself
do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew
let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait
god will wait as long as it takes for us
waiting is not mere empty hoping
it has the inner certainty of reaching the goal
all things come to him who waits provided he knows what he is waiting for
hope and patience are two sovereign remedies for all the surest reposals the softest cushions to lean on in adversity
the strongest of all warriors are these twotime and patience
who bides his time tastes the sweet of honey in the saltiest tear and though he fares with slowest feet joy runs to meet him drawing near
god grant us patience
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
there is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it
patience is the best remedy for every trouble
for ye have need of patience
they are ill discoverers that think there is no land when they see nothing but sea
the best way out of a difficulty is through it
many things difficult to design prove easy to performance
a diplomat is a man who remembers a ladys birthday but forgets her age
when a diplomat says yes he means perhaps when he says perhaps he means no when he says no he is no diplomat
i have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats
i speak the truth and they never believe me
diplomacy is to do and say the nastiest thing in the nicest way
disappointment is the nurse of wisdom
the bestlaid schemes o mice an men gang aft agley and leave us nought but grief and pain for promised joy
disappointments are to the soul what a thunderstorm is to the air
men would be angels angels would be gods
now is the winter of our discontent
i was born to other things
discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation
discretion in speech is more than eloquence
a sound discretion is not so much indicated by never making a mistake as by never repeating it
great ability without discretion comes almost invariably to a tragic end
let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action
the better part of valour is discretion
disease is the retribution of outraged nature
disease is an experience of socalled mortal mind
it is fear made manifest on the body
desperate diseases require desperate remedies
some remedies are worse than the disease
whatever disgrace we may have deserved it is almost always in our power to reestablish our character
no one can disgrace us but ourselves
doubt the man who swears to his devotion
women distrust men too much in general and too little in particular
what loneliness is more lonely than distrust
doctrine is nothing but the skin of truth set up and stuffed
how absurd to try to make two men think alike on matters of religion when i cannot make two timepieces agree
in religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed than for diose who deny the whole of it
you can and you cant you will and you wont youll be damnd if you do youll be damnd if you dont
orthodoxy my lord said bishop warburton in a whisper    orthodoxy is my doxy    heterodoxy is another mans doxy
do not disturb the sleeping dog
every dog is entitled to one bite
who loves me will love my dog also
youre only a dog old fellow a dog and youve had your day but never a friend of all my friends has been truer than you alway
i agree with agassiz that dogs possess something very like a conscience
oh the saddest of sights in a world of sin is a little lost pup with his tail tucked in
foxterriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs
the more one comes to know men the more one comes to admire the dog
the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
the cowardly dog barks more violently than it bites
every dog must have his day
gentlemen of die jury the one absolute unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world the one that never deserts him the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog
galileo called doubt the father of invention it is certainly the pioneer
of that there is no manner of doubt   no probable possible shadow of doubt   no possible doubt whatever
we know accurately only when we know little with knowledge doubt increases
when in doubt win the trick
i respect faith but doubt is what gets you an education
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt
there lives more faith in honest doubt believe me than in half the creeds
im from missouri you must show me
unrest and uncertainty are our lot
life is uncertain
eat dessert first
if we insist on being as sure as is conceivable  we must be content to creep along the ground and can never soar
nothing perhaps is strange once you have accepted life itself the great strange business which includes all lesser strangeness
the shortest period of time lies between the minute you put some money away for a rainy day and the unexpected arrival of rain
our lives are never certain even for an hour
throughout this life you can never be certain of living long enough to take another breath
i wanted a perfect ending
now ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end
life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
where will i be five years from now
i delight in not knowing
the longing for certainty  is in every human mind
but certainty is generally illusion
no great deed is done by falterers who ask for certainty
every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge
we are not certain we are never certain
we live in an epoch in which the solid ground of our preconceived ideas shakes daily under our certain feet
all business proceeds on beliefs or judgment of probabilities and not on certainties
the man who insists upon seeing with perfect clearness before he decides never decides
there is nothing certain in a mans life but that he must lose it
ah what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life
when i was young i was sure of everything in a few years having been mistaken a thousand times i was not half so sure of most things as i was before at present i am hardly sure of anything but what god has revealed
we can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand
you are all you will ever have for certain
certitude is not the test of certainty
we have been cocksure of many things that were not so
a reasonable probability is the only certainty
doubt is not a pleasant state but certainty is a ridiculous one
being unready and illequipped is what you have to expect in life
it is the universal predicament
it is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes
circumstances are seldom right
you never have the capacities the strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have
you must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen
to be absolutely certain about something one must know everything or nothing about it
free man is by necessity insecure thinking man by necessity uncertain
we sail within a vast sphere ever drifting in uncertainty driven from end to end
something must be left to chance nothing is sure in a sea fight
there is nothing certain about war except that one side wont win
there is only one thing about which i am certain and this is that there is very little about which one can be certain
the only certainty is that nothing is certain
im often wrong but never in doubt
there is one thing certain namely that we can have nothing certain therefore it is not certain that we can have nothing certain
every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable
any coward can fight a battle when hes sure of winning
the demand is for certainty is a sign of weakness
the unknown is what it is
and to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that
accept that its unknown and its plain sailing
only a weak mind seeks ultimate answers
when nothing is sure everything is possible
he who forecasts all perils will never sail the sea
there is a time for departure even when theres no certain place to go
one doesnt discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of shore for a very long time
to teach how to live with uncertainty yet without being paralyzed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy can do
faith  acts promptly and boldly on the occasion on slender evidence
if we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late
the successful man is he who when he sees that no further certainty is attainable promptly decides on the most probable side as if he were completely sure it was right
not seeing is halfbelieving
the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touchedthey must be felt with the heart
there is no advancement to him who stands trembling because he cannot see the end from the beginning
i am a woman who understands the necessity of an impulse whose goal or origin still lie beyond me
to end with certainty we must begin with doubting
gardening is an exercise in optimism
in the face of uncertainty there is nothing wrong with hope
no object is mysterious
the mystery is your eye
faith hasnt got no eyes but shes longlegged
maturity of mind is the capacity to endure uncertainty
dont be afraid of the space between your dreams and reality
if you can dream it you can make it so
if a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts but if he will content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties
i said heres the river i want to flow on heres the direction i want to go and put my boat in
i was ready for the river to take unexpected turns and present obstacles
the future is no more uncertain than the present
nobody can really guarantee the future
the best we can do is size up the chances calculate the risks involved estimate our ability to deal with them and make our plans with confidence
every time i think that im getting old and gradually going to the grave something else happens
many live in dread of what is coming
why should we
the unknown puts adventure into life

the unexpected around the corner gives a sense of anticipation and surprise
thank god for the unknown future
i think i look good out there
im strong powerful and artistic
but i have my doubts as much as anyone
if i ever felt inclined to be timid as i was going into a room full of people i would say to myself youre the cleverest member of one of the cleverest families in the cleverest class of the cleverest nation
why should you be frightened
action will remove the doubts that theory cannot solve
to death i yield but not to doubt who slays before
soon after a heartwrung decision something inevitably occurs to cast doubt on your choice
holding steady against that doubt usually proves your decision
doubt breeds doubt
its the moment you think you cant that you realize you can
from a shy timid girl i had become a woman of resolute character who could no longer be frightened by the struggle with troubles
doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother
doubts and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination which the steadfast heart will conquer and the large mind transcend
doubt indulged soon becomes doubt realized
when one devotes oneself to meditation mental burdens unnecessary worries and wandering thoughts drop off one by one life seems to run smoothly and pleasantly
a student may now depend on intuition to make decisions
as one acts on intuition second thought with its dualism doubt and hesitation does not arise
in doubt fear is the worst of prophets
the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
let us move forward with strong and active faith
in case of doubt decide in favor of what is correct
faith and doubt both are needed not as antagonists but working side by side to take us around the unknown curve
our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win by fearing to attempt
a mans doubts and fears are his worst enemies
when in doubt do it
yes i have doubted
i have wandered off the path but i always return
it is intuitive an intrinsic builtin sense of direction
i seem always to find my way home
a person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself
doubt whom you will but never yourself
self distrust is the cause of most of our failures
in the assurance of strength there is strength and they are the weakest however strong who have no faith in themselves or their own powers
doubt yourself and you doubt everything you see
judge yourself and you see judges everywhere
but if you listen to the sound of your own voice you can rise above doubt and judgment
and you can see forever
to be ambitious for wealth and yet always expecting to be poor to be always doubting your ability to get what you long for is like trying to reach east by traveling west
there is no philosophy which will help a man to succeed when he is always doubting his ability to do so and thus attracting failure
no matter how hard you work for success if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure it will kill your efforts neutralize your endeavors and make success impossible
uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life
security is an insipid thing
i used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way i could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at bogie
that was the beginning of the look
when nothing is sure everything is possible
uncertainty and mystery are energies of life
dont let them scare you unduly for they keep boredom at bay and spark creativity
the quest for certainty blocks the search for meaning
uncertainty is the very condition to impel man to unfold his powers
all uncertainly is fruitful so long as it is accompanied by the wish to understand
im delighted that the future is unsure
thats the way it should be
when we are not sure we are alive
freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst
the only thing that makes life possible is permanent intolerable uncertainty not knowing what comes next
in the face of uncertainty there is nothing wrong with hope
if there were dreams to sell merry and sad to tell and the crier rung his bell what would you buy
i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls with vassals and serfs at my side
abou ben adhem may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
for dhrames always go by conthraries my dear
we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep
till the day when ill be going down that long long trail with you
when youre all dressed up and no place to go
if a woman were about to proceed to her execution she would demand a little time to perfect her toilet
eat to please thyself but dress to please others
a torchlight procession marching down your throat
first you take a drink then the drink takes a drink then the drink takes you
for when the wine is in the wit is out
he neither drank smoked nor rode a bicycle
living frugally saving his money he died early surrounded by greedy relatives
it was a great lesson to me
he who drinks a little too much drinks much too much
i am only a beer teetotaller not a champagne teetotaller
the worst thing about some men is that when they are not drunk they are sober
i have never been drunk but ive often been overserved
in vino veritas
in wine there is truth
the morning cup of coffee has an exhilaration about it which the cheering influence of the afternoon or evening cup of tea cannot be expected to reproduce
they talk of my drinking but never my thirst
what when drunk one sees in other women one sees in garbo sober
you are not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on
i like liquor  its taste and its effects  and that is just the reason why i never drink it
the persians are very fond of wine
it is also their general practice to deliberate upon affairs of weight when they are drunk and then in the morning when they are sober the decision to which they came the night before is put before them by the master of the house in which it was made and if it is then approved they act on it if not they set it aside
sometimes however they are sober at their first deliberations but in this case they always reconsider the matter under the influence of wine
drunkenness is temporary suicide the happiness that it brings is merely negative a momentary cessation of unhappiness
bacchus has drowned more men than neptune
temperance is the control of all the functions of our bodies
the man who refuses liquor goes in for apple pie and develops a paunch is no ethical leader for me
nothing ever tasted any better than a cold beer on a beautiful afternoon with nothing to look forward to but more of the same
moderation is commonly firm and firmness is commonly successful
abstinence is as easy for me as temperance would be difficult
i drink to make other people interesting
one of the disadvantages of wine is that is makes a man mistake words for thoughts
the innkeeper loves the drunkard but not for a soninlaw
whisky drowns some troubles and floats a lot more

an irish queer a fellow who prefers women to drink
jellineks disease alcoholism is responsible for 50 percent of all auto fatalities 80 percent of all home violence 30 percent of all suicides 60 percent of all child abuse 65 percent of all drownings it is estimated that when a woman contracts the disease her husband leaves her in nine out often cases when a man contracts it his wife leaves in one out of ten cases
eat bread at pleasure drink wine by measure
we frequently hear of people dying from too much drinking
that this happens is a matter of record
but the blame almost always is placed on whisky
why this should be i never could understand
you can die from drinking too much of anything  coffee water milk soft drinks and all such stuff as that
and so long as the presence of death lurks with anyone who goes through the simple act of swallowing i will make mine whisky
its a naive domestic burgundy without any breeding but i think youll be amused by its presumption
drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness
there are more old drunkards than old physicians

i always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case i see a snake  which i also keep handy
we had gone out there to pass the beautiful day of high summer like true irishmen  locked in the dark snug of a public house
the whole world is about three drinks behind
drunkenness is temporary suicide the happiness that it brings is merely negative a momentary cessation of unhappiness
there was an old hen and she had a wooden leg and every damned morning she laid another egg she was the best damned chicken on the whole damned farm   and another little drink wouldnt do us any harm
its a long time between drinks
he is a drunkard who takes more than three glasses though he be not drunk
drink today and drown all sorrow you shall perhaps not do it tomorrow
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them
the habit of using ardent spirits by men in office has occasioned more injury to the public and more trouble to me than all other causes
were i to commence my administration again the first question i would ask respecting a candidate for office would be does he use ardent spirits
i would appeal to philip she said but to philip sober
drink
for you know not whence you came nor why drink
for you know not why you go nor where
all excess is ill but drunkeness is of the worst sort
it spoils health dismounts the mind and unmans men
it reveals secrets is quarrelsome lascivious impudent dangerous and bad
there st john mingles with my friendly bowl the feat of reason and the flow of soul
water is the only drink for a wise man
to do my duty in that state of life unto which it shall please god to call me
it is thy duty oftentimes to do what thou wouldst not thy duty too to leave undone that thou wouldst do
so nigh is grandeur to our dust so near is god to man
when duty whispers low thou must the youth replies i can
no personal consideration should stand in the way of performing a public duty
let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
england expects every man to do his duty
theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to do and die

thou shouldst eat to live not live to eat
the nearer the bone the sweeter the meat
i want every peasant to have a chicken in his pot on sundays
when i demanded of my friend what viands he preferred he quoth a large cold bottle and a small hot bird
let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die
for a man seldom thinks with more earnestness of anything than he does of his dinner
man shall not live by bread alone
the way to a mans heart is through his stomach
better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith

you may have a fresh start any moment you choose for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down
failure is a disappointment but not defeat
memories are the key not to the past but to the future
failure is delay but not defeat
it is a temporary detour not a deadend street
finite to fail but infinite to venture
when in doubt make a fool of yourself
there is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth
so what the hell leap
failure really isnt terrible if you can say to yourself hey i know im gonna be successful at what i want to do someday
failure doesnt become a big hangup then because its only temporary
if failure is absolute then it would be a disaster but as long as its only temporary you can just go and achieve almost anything
failure is an event never a person
it is better to be boldly decisive and risk being wrong than to agonize at length and be right too late
ive never met a person i dont care what his condition in whom i could not see possibilities
i dont care how much a man may consider himself a failure i believe in him for he can change the thing that is wrong in his life anytime he is prepared and ready to do it
whenever he develops the desire he can take away from his life the thing that is defeating it
the capacity for reformation and change lies within
i think and think for months for years
ninetynine times the conclusion is false
the hundredth time i am right
take chances make mistakes
thats how you grow
pain nourishes your courage
you have to fail in order to practice being brave
take risks
you cant fall off the bottom
when it goes wrong you feel like cutting your throat but you go on
you dont let anything get you down so much that it beats you or stops you
you must have longrange goals to keep you from being frustrated by shortrange failures
life is a series of relapses and recoveries
we learn courageous action by going forward whenever fear urges us back
a little boy was asked how he learned to skate
by getting up every time i fell down he answered
if i had to live my life over again id dare to make more mistakes next time
failure is only postponed success as long as courage coaches ambition
the habit of persistence is the habit of victory
entrepreneurs average 38 failures before final success
what sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence
there are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat
success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm
i dont accept defeat as final
only death is final  and even then i hope for a reprieve
never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat
mens best successes come after their disappointments
ive been failing for like ten or eleven years
when it turns itll turn
right now im just tryin to squeeze through a very tight financial period get the movie out and put my things in order
dont let a kick in the ass stop you
its how you cope that says what you are
what is to be got at to make the air sweet the ground good under the feet can only be got at by failure trial again and again and again failure

not all who fail have therefore worked in vain
there is no failure for the good and brave
no honest work of man or woman fails it feeds the sum of all human action
defeat in doing right is nevertheless victory
the only failure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best
sometimes what you want to do has to fail so you wont

an error gracefully acknowledged is a victory won
nothing succeeds like failure
because a fellow has failed once or twice or a dozen times you dont want to set him down as a failure until hes dead or loses his courage   and thats the same thing
what we have most to fear is failure of the heart
no man is a failure who is enjoying life
you are beaten to earth
well well whats that
come up with a smiling face its nothing against you to fall down flat but to lie there  thats disgrace
he alone fails who gives up and lies down
never give a man up until he has failed at something he likes
failure is not in losing but in no longer believing that winning is worthwhile
hes no failure
hes not dead yet
inside of a ring or out aint nothing wrong with going down
its staying down thats wrong
it aint no disgrace for a man to fall but to lie there and grunt is
if you have made mistakes even serious ones there is always another chance for you
what we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down
if a man has a talent and cannot use it he has failed
if he has a talent and uses only half of it he has partly failed
if he has a talent and learns somehow to use the whole of it he has gloriously succeeded and won a satisfaction and a triumph few men ever know
not failure but low aim is a crime
there is only one real failure in life that is possible and that is not to be true to the best one knows

men must try and try again
in the past few women have tried and even fewer have succeeded
a mistake is not a failure but evidence that someone tried to do something
man must strive and in striving he must err
the person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy inevitable part of the process of getting to the top
failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure

your success depends on your ability to dream and follow through on those dreams
keep trying

it is better to be young in your failures than old in your successes
there might be false starts and doovers
you are entitled to experiment before you find your calling
life is the only real counselor
wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become a part of the moral tissue
the only failure which lacks dignity is the failure to try
to know that one has never really tried  that is the only death
we have to keep trying things were not sure we can pull off
if we just do the things we know we can do  you dont grow as much
you gotta take those chances on making those big mistakes
if youre not failing youre not trying anything
if you play it safe in life youve decided that you dont want to grow anymore
those who try and fail are much wiser than those who never try for fear of failure
a mans life is interesting primarily when he has failed  i well know

a stumble may prevent a fall
a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing
it is defeat that turns bone to flint it is defeat that turns gristle to muscle it is defeat that makes men invincible
do not then be afraid of defeat
you are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause
besides the practical knowledge which defeat offers there are important personality profits to be taken
defeat strips away false values and makes you realize what you really want
it stops you from chasing butterflies and puts you to work digging gold
no experiment is ever a complete failure
it can always be used as a bad example
failure is the foundation of success and the means by which it is achieved

we will be victorious if we have not forgotten how to learn
it is the true nature of mankind to learn from mistakes not from example
the psychotherapist learns little or nothing from his successes
they mainly confirm him in his mistakes while his failures on the other hand are priceless experiences in that they not only open up the way to a deeper truth but force him to change his views and methods

faith is one of the forces by which men live the total absence of it means collapse
pity the human being who is not able to connect faith within himself with the infinite
he who has faith has  an inward reservoir of courage hope confidence calmness and assuring trust that all will come out welleven though to the world it may appear to come out most badly
faith is a gift of god
through the dark and stormy night faith beholds a feeble light up the blackness streaking knowing gods own time is best in a patient hope i rest for the full daybreaking
to win true peace a man needs to feel himself directed pardoned and sustained by a supreme power to feel himself in the right road at the point where god would have him bein order with god and the universe
this faith gives strength and calm
faith may be relied upon to produce sustained action and more rarely sustained contemplation
the person who has a firm trust in the supreme being is powerful in his power wise by his wisdom happy by his happiness
the disease with which the human mind now labors is want of faith
as your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control that things will flow as they will and that you will flow with them to your great delight and benefit
the historic glory of america lies in the fact that it is the one nation that was founded like a church
that is it was founded on a faith that was not merely summed up after it had exited but was defined before it existed
the only faith that wears well and holds its color in all weather is that which is woven of conviction
the primary cause of unhappiness in the world today is  lack of faith
you do build in darkness if you have faith
when the light returns you have made of yourself a fortress which is impregnable to certain kinds of trouble you may even find yourself needed and sought by others as a beacon in their dark
it is by faith that poetry as well as devotion soars above this dull earth that imagination breaks through its clouds breathes a purer air and lives in a softer light
religious faith indeed relates to that which is above us but it must arise from that which is within us
faith enables persons to be persons because it lets god be god
faith makes the discords of the present the harmonies of the future
a person consists of his faith
whatever is his faith even so is he
in israel in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles
for the believer there is no question for the nonbeliever there is no answer
life without faith in something is too narrow a space in which to live
something will turn up
love means to commit oneself without guarantee to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person
love is an act of faith and whoever is of little faith is also of little love
above all things have devoted love among yourselves for love covers a multitude of sins
love one another and you will be happy
its as simple and as difficult as that
because god is love the most important lesson he wants you to learn on earth is how to love
love is not blind  it sees more not less
but because it sees more it is willing to see less
since love grows within you so beauty grows
for love is the beauty of the soul
if you judge people you have no time to love them
the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death
hatred paralyzes life love releases it
hatred confuses life love harmonizes it
hatred darkens life love illumines it
whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer him with love
time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity
nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold
tell me who admires and loves you and i will tell you who you are
i have been astonished that men could die martyrs for their religion i have shudderd at it
i shudder no more
i could be martyrd for my religion love is my religion and i could die for that
i could die for you
bitterness imprisons life love releases it
bitterness paralyzes life love empowers it
bitterness sours life love sweetens it
bitterness sickens life love heals it
bitterness blinds life love anoints its eyes
no cord nor cable can so forcibly draw or hold so fast as love can do with a twined thread
i believe that life is given us so that we may grow in love and i believe that god is in me as the sun is in the color and fragrance of a flower
there is only one path to heaven
on earth we call it love
treasure the love you receive above all
it will survive long after your gold and good health have vanished
give all to love obey thy heart
tis the most tender part of love each other to forgive
never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you love prayer and forgiveness
love blinds us to faults hatred to virtues
agape is disinterested love



agape does not begin by discriminating between worthy and unworthy people or any qualities people possess
it begins by loving others for their sakes



therefore agape makes no distinction between friend and enemy it is directed toward both
do not waste time bothering whether you love your neighbor act as if you did
as soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets
when you are behaving as if you loved someone you will presently come to love him
if you injure someone you dislike you will find yourself disliking him more
if you do him a good turn you will find yourself disliking him less
we are obliged to love one another
we are not strictly bound to like one another
to love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to love everything  to love god in all his manifestations  human love serves to love those dear to us but to love ones enemies we need divine love
love is what we were borne with
fear is what we learned here
the higher animals are in a sense drawn into man when he loves them and makes them as he does much more nearly human than they would otherwise be
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him
beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
were born alone we live alone we die alone
only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone
love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness
that best portion of a good mans life his little nameless unremembered acts of kindness and of love
a thing of beauty is a joy forever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness
god loves us the way we are but too much to leave us that way
though our feelings come and go gods love for us does not
love is a fruit in season at all times and within reach of every hand
all wise people say the same thing that you are deserving of love and that its all here now everything you need
when you pray you are not starting the conversation from scratch just remembering to plug back into a conversation thats always in progress
speak to me of love said st francis to the almond tree and the tree blossomed
faith is the continuation of reason
faith is to believe what we do not see and the reward of this faith is to see what we believe
an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace
ah i have seen teaches me to trust the creator for all i have not seen
faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
here i stand
i can do no otherwise

glory is fleeting but obscurity is forever
have regard for your name since it will remain for you longer than a great store of gold
i have touchd the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting
men are much more unwilling to have their weaknesses and their imperfections known than their crimes
one of the drawbacks of fame is that one can never escape from it
popularity is a crime from the moment it is sought it is only a virtue where men have it whether they will or not
that sovereign of insufferables
the only man who wasnt spoilt by being lionized was daniel
the ordinary man casts a shadow in a way we do not quite understand
the man of genius casts light

when i pass my name in such large letters i blush but at the same time instinctively raise my hat
fame is the sum of the misunderstanding that gathers about a new name
what a heavy burden is a name that has become too famous
now when i bore people at a party they think its their fault
one must choose between obscurity with efficiency and fame with its inevitable collateral of bluff
one lives in the hope of becoming a memory
after i am dead i would rather have men ask why cato has no monument than why he had one
fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else
the greatest monarch on the proudest throne is obliged to sit upon his own arse
all celebrated people lose dignity on a close view
a celebrity is a person known for his wellknownness
celebrities intensify their celebrity images simply by being well known for relations among themselves
by a kind of symbiosis celebrities live off each other
before such a prodigious career judgement is torn between blame and admiration
famous remarks are very seldom quoted correctly
it is strange how the memory of a man may float to posterity on what he would have himself regarded as the most trifling of his works
to be somebody you must last
the world like an accomplished hostess pays most attention to those whom it will soonest forget
public opinion a vulgar impertinent anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for any one of us who is not content to be the average man
mans attitude toward great qualities in others is often the same as toward high mountains  he admires them but he prefers to walk around them
all the fame i look for in life is to have lived it quietly
a celebrity is one who is known to many persons he is glad he doesnt know
fame is a bee it has a song  it has a sting  ah too it has a wing
a sign of a celebrity is often that his name is worth more than his services
martyrdom is the only way a man can become famous without ability
he that hath the name to be an early riser may sleep till noon
some day each of us will be famous for fifteen minutes
i awoke one morning and found myself famous
to many fame comes too late
if you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead either write things worth reading or do things worth writing
men think highly of those who rise rapidly in the world whereas nothing rises quicker than dust straw and feathers
fame is the perfume of heroic deeds
fame is but the breath of the people and that often unwholesome
no true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind
what a heavy burden is a name that has become too famous
in fames temple there is always a niche to be found for rich dunces importunate scoundrels or successful butchers of the human race
familiarity breeds contempt
though familiarity may not breed contempt it takes off the edge of admiration
the living together for three long rainy days in the country has done more to dispel love than all the perfidies in love that have ever been committed
he who has daughters is always a shepherd
i am married to beatrice salkeld a painter
we have no children except me
i dont know who my grandfather was i am much more concerned to know what his grandson will be
i have called the principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term of natural selection
mothers can get weaned as well as babies
there are no illegitimate children  only illegitimate parents
all happy families resemble one another every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
the dark uneasy world of family life  where the greatest can fail and the humblest succeed
as a general thing when a woman wears the pants in a family she has a good right to them
i am he as you are me and we are all together
of all my wifes relations i like myself the best
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort
when family relations are no longer harmonious we have filial children and devoted parents
the family is the american fascism
the thing that impresses me most about north america is the way parents obey their children
who of us is mature enough for offspring before the offspring themselves arrive
the value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults
absence is one of the most useful ingredients of family life and to do it rightly is an art like any other
no matter how many communes anybody invents the family always creeps back
there are fathers who do not love their children there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson
the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother
today while the titular head of the family may still be the father everyone knows that he is little more than chairman at most of the entertainment committee
a mothers love for her child is like nothing else in the world
it knows no aw no pity it dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path
mother love has been much maligned
an over mothered boy may go through life expecting each new woman to love him the way his mother did
her love may make any other love seem inadequate
but an unloved boy would be even more likely to idealize love
i dont think its possible for a mother or father to love a child too much
unconditional love is loving your kids for who they are not for what they do  it isnt something you will achieve every minute of every day
but it is the thought we must hold in our hearts every day
the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother
where does the family start
it starts with a young man falling in love with a girl  no superior alternative has yet been found
of course if you like your kids if you love them from the moment they begin you yourself begin all over again in them and with them
you can see them alongside the shuffleboard courts in florida or on the porches of the old folks homes up north
they are in love they have always been in love although sometimes they would have denied it
and because they have been in love they have survived everything that life could throw at them even their own failures
in family life love is the oil that eases friction the cement that binds closer together and the music that brings harmony
family love is messy clinging and of an annoying and repetitive pattern like bad wallpaper
in truth a family is what you make it
it is made strong not by number of heads counted at the dinner table but by the rituals you help family members create by the memories you share by the commitment of time caring and love you show to one another and by the hopes for the future you have as individuals and as a unit
a mother discovers with great delight that one does not love ones children just because they are ones children but because of the friendship formed while raising them
the family is the country of the heart
there is an angel in the family who by the mysterious influence of grace of sweetness and of love renders the fulfillment of duties less wearisome sorrows less bitter
the only pure joys unmixed with sadness
smile at each other smile at your wife smile at your husband smile at your children smile at each other  it doesnt matter who it is and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other
no man has ever lived that had enough of childrens gratitude or womans love
i take my children everywhere but they always find their way back home
happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city
the real question isnt whether or not you love your kids but how well you are able to demonstrate your love and caring so that your children really feel loved
the last step in parental love involves the release of the beloved the willing cutting of the cord that would otherwise keep the child in a state of emotional dependence
so if you have a grandma thank the good lord up above and give grandmama hugs and kisses for grandmothers are to love
oh i love to see a man with a cigar
it reminds me of my grandfather
morning to night he used to sit with a great big stogie dangling from his lips
oh the hours we kids used to spend sitting on his lap playing with the yellow whiskers beneath his nose
then hed take out his teeth with the cigar still in them and chase us around the room
wed all laugh and laugh


then suddenly grampas mood would change and wed all have to run for our lives



you cant buy memories like that
children begin by loving their parents
after a time they judge them
rarely if ever do they forgive them
it is my pleasure that my children are free and happy and unrestrained by parental tyranny
love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents
perfect love sometimes does not come until the first grandchild
the reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy
the whole world is my family
to us family means putting your arms around each other and being there
the happiest moments of my life have been the few which i have passed at home in the bosom of my family
the family with an old person in it possesses a jewel
babies are such a nice way to start people
each time a new baby is born there is a possibility of reprieve
each child is a new being a potential prophet a new spiritual prince a new spark of light precipitated into the outer darkness
bringing a child into the world is the greatest act of hope there is
children are the worlds most valuable resource and its best hope for the future
blessed be childhood which brings down something of heaven into the midst of our rough earthliness
children are the bridge to heaven
we are given children to test us and make us more spiritual
one laugh of a child will make the holiest day more sacred still
children are the true connoisseurs
whats precious to them has no price  only value
there are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of a child
there are seven million
children like animals use all their senses to discover the world
then artists come along and discover it the same way all over again
the only artists for whom i would make way are  children
for me the paintings of children belong side by side with the works of the masters
why a fouryearold child could understand this report
run out and find me a fouryearold child
adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up  cause theyre looking for ideas
what do we teach our children



we should say to each of them do you know what you are
you are a marvel
you are unique


you may become a shakespeare a michelangelo a beethoven
you have the capacity for anything
by giving children lots of affection you can help fill them with love and acceptance of themselves
then thats what they will have to give away
teaching kids to count is fine but teaching them what counts is best
it is infinitely more useful for a child to hear a story told by a person than by computer
because the greatest part of the learning experience lies not in the particular words of the story but in the involvement with the individual reading it
the parents exist to teach the child but also they must learn what the child has to teach them and the child has a very great deal to teach them
grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure
therefore the great spirit may show to them many things which older people miss
children have a remarkable talent for not taking the adult world with the kind of respect we are so confident it ought to be given
to the irritation of authority figures of all sorts children expend considerable energy in clowning around
they refuse to appreciate the gravity of our monumental concerns while we forget that if we were to become more like children our concerns might not be so monumental
youth i stay close to the young and a little rubs off
those who love the young best stay young longer
as long as i continue to hear normal people telling me i am too childish i know im doing just fine
one of the most obvious facts about grownups to a child is that they have forgotten what it is like to be a child
all of us collect fortunes when we are children
a fortune of colors of lights and darkness of movement of tensions
some of us have the fantastic chance to go back to his fortune when grown up
so like a forgotten fire a childhood can always flare up again within us
the great man is he that does not lose his childheart
what god is to the world parents are to their children
honor your father and your mother
honor your father and mother even as you honor god for all three were partners in your creation
when i was a boy of fourteen my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around
but when i got to be twentyone i was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years
remember no matter how many candles you blow out this year theres one gal who will always think of you as young strong and handsome  your mother
theres no way to be a perfect mother and a million ways to be a good one
god could not be everywhere therefore he made mothers
parents are often so busy with the physical rearing of children that they miss the glory of parenthood just as the grandeur of the trees is lost when raking leaves
the best inheritance a parent can give his children is a few minutes of his time each day
if i had known how wonderful it would be to have grandchildren id have had them first
few things are more delightful than grandchildren fighting over your lap
the greatest sweetener of human life is friendship
a friend might well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature
of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy much the greatest is the possession of friendship
friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together
the glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him
what a great blessing is a friend with a heart so trusty you may safely bury all your secrets in it
when a friend is in trouble dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do
think up something appropriate and do it
a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
the most i can do for my friend is simply to be his friend
friendship improves happiness and abates misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief
it is not what you give your friend but what you are willing to give him that determines the quality of your friendship
a friend is someone who knows all about you and loves you just the same
it is not the talking that counts between friends it is the never needing to say what counts
true friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable
friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies
to be a good friend remember that we are human magnets that like attracts like and that as we give we get
treat your friends as you do your pictures and place them in their best light
friendships are fragile things and require as much care in handling as any other fragile and precious thing
every man should have a fairsized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends
since there is nothing so well worth having as friends never lose a chance to make them
you can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you
the only way to have a friend is to be one
friends will not only live in harmony but in melody
it is great to have friends when one is young but indeed it is still more so when you are getting old
when we are young friends are like everything else a matter of course
in the old days we know what it means to have them
old friends are best
king james used to call for his old shoes they were the easiest for his feet
each of us has a spark of life inside us and our highest endeavor ought to be to set off that spark in one another
sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being
each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light
theres no way that moving in with your parents is a sign that your life is on track
cleaning your house while your children are still growing is like shoveling the walk before it stops snowing
insanity is hereditary you get it from your children
the best way to keep children home is to make the home atmosphere pleasant   and let the air out of the tires
happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family  in another city
human beings are the only creatures on earth that allow children to come back home
children have become so expensive that only the poor can afford them
never brag about your ancestors coming over on the mayflower the immigration laws werent as strict in those days

my son has taken up meditation  at least its better than sitting doing nothing
a scout is a boy who dresses like a schmuck
a scoutmaster is a schmuck who dresses like a boy
it appears theres a little too much chlorine in their gene pool
in america there are two classes of travel   first class and with children
the best thing to do is to behave in a manner befitting ones age
if you are sixteen and under try not to go bald
i think a dysfunctional family is any family with more than one person in it
family is just accident



they dont mean to get on your nerves
they dont even mean to be your family they just are
my father told me marijuana would cause me brain damage  because if he caught me doing it he was going to break my head
were supposed to take our problems to a family adviser
personally ive never met a family adviser
theyre all off somewhere listening to dirty stories
the reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy
have children while your parents are still young enough to take care of them
lets face it theres lots of spoiled kids out there


because you cant spank grandma
family life got better and we got our car back   as soon as we put i love mom on the license plate
you know your children are growing up when they stop asking where they came from and refuse to tell you where theyre going
i hate housework
you make the beds you do the dishes  and six months later you have to start all over again
i dont want to say anything about my kids


but i go to pta meetings under an assumed name
the jewish man with parents still alive is a fifteenyearold boy and will remain a fifteenyearold boy until they die
few mistakes can be made by a motherinlaw who is willing to babysit
adolescence is when children start trying to bring up their parents
adults are just children who earn money
i read one psychologists theory that said never strike a child in your anger
when could i strike him
when he is kissing me on my birthday
when hes recuperating from measles
do i slap the bible out of his hand on sunday
it takes about five years for a walnut tree to produce nuts but this is not true of a family tree
my father never raised his hand to any one of his children  except in selfdefense
to encourage my little kid to eat id sometimes say just pretend its sand
ask your child what he wants for dinner only if hes buying
sis ive been wondering


on my birthday mom always gives me five thousand dollars
how much does she give you
my kid asked if he could borrow ten dollars
when i only gave him five dollars he said okay since you owe me the other five dollars well call it even
never raise your hands to your kids
it leaves your groin unprotected
never lend your car to someone youve given birth to
we were so poor we had no hot water
but it didnt matter because we had no bathtub to put it in anyway
in most states you can get a drivers license when youre sixteen years old which made a lot of sense to me when i was sixteen years old but now seems insane
home is the place when you have to go there they have to take you in
i love being a greatgrandparent but what i hate is being the the mother of a grandparent
i want you to know how i feel about my italian heritage so id like to say a few words in italian verdi pavarotti dimaggio valentino de niro giuliani


a child prodigy is one with highly imaginative parents
ive just been to a debutant ball where all the girls were wearing lowcut gowns
its clear why theyre called coming out parties
when i reprimanded my son for hair like michael jackson he said i dont see the problem you wear yours like michael jordan
watching your daughter being collected by her date feels like handing over a milliondollar stradivarius to a gorilla
insanity runs in my family
it practically gallops
keep in mind  to a dog you are family to a cat you are staff
the happiest moments of my life have been the few which i have passed at home in the bosom of my family
there is little less trouble in governing a private family than a whole kingdom
none but a mule denies his family
fare thee well
and if for ever still for ever fare thee well
sweets to the sweet farewell
a farmer is always going to be rich next year
farming is a most senseless pursuit a mere laboring in a circle
you sow that you may reap and then you reap that you may sow
nothing ever comes of it
some people tell us that there aint no hell but they never farmed so how can they tell
those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of god if he ever had a chosen people whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue
the farmer works the soil the agriculturist works the farmer
let us never forget that the cultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man
when tillage begins other arts follow
the farmers therefore are the founders of civilization
a love of fashion makes the economy go round
a pious man is one who would be an atheist if the king were
every generation laughs at the old fashions but religiously follows the new
nothing is so hideous as an obsolete fashion
the tradition of the new
yesterdays avantgardexperiment is todays chic and tomorrows cliche
art produces ugly things which frequently become beautiful with time
fashion on the other hand produces beautiful things which always become ugly with time
be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside
fashion can be bought
style one must possess
fashion which elevates the bad to the level of the good subsequently turns its back on bad and good alike
even knowledge has to be in fashion and where it is not it is wise to affect ignorance
the fashion wears out more apparel than the man
fashions after all are only induced epidemics
when a man is once in fashion all he does is right
i have heard with admiring submission the experience of the lady who declared that the sense of being welldressed gives a feeling of inward tranquility which religion is powerless to bestow
fashion condemns us to many follies the greatest is to make oneself its slave
conformism is so hot on the heels of the massproduced avantgarde that the ins and the outs change places with the speed of mach 3
there goes a man made by the lord almighty and not by his tailor
fashions fade  style is eternal
and by my grave youd pray to have me back so i could see how well you look in black
a man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress
a fashionable woman is always in love  with herself
i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man
fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months
certainty generally is illusion and repose is not the destiny of man
how many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man
heaven is the place where the donkey finally catches up with his carrot hell is the eternity while he waits for it
continuous effort  not strength or intelligence  is the key to unlocking our potential
that that is is
everything passes everything wears out everything breaks
tout passe tout lasse tout casse
whatsoer we perpetrate we do but row we are steered by fate
whatever limits us we call fate
whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time
certain signs precede certain events
see how the fates their gifts allot
for a is happy  b is not
yet b is worthy i dare say of more prosperity than a
destiny n a tyrants authority for crime and a fools excuse for failure
fate rules the affairs of mankind with no recognizable order
he who does not desire or fear the uncertain day or capricious fate is equal to the gods above and loftier than mortals
the worst is not always certain but its very likely
it is a long road from conception to completion
god keeps the wicked to give them time to repent
fortune is fickle and soon asks back what he has given
destiny is what you are supposed to do in life
fate is what kicks you in the ass to make you do it
that which god writes on thy forehead thou wilt come to it
when its time has come the prey goes to the hunter
the bow is bent the arrow flies the winged shaft of fate
he has gone to the demnition bowwows
tis fate that flings the dice and as she flings of kings makes peasants and of peasants kings
thou must in commanding and winning or serving and losing suffering or triumphing be either anvil or hammer
we make our fortunes and we call them fate
though men determine the gods do dispose and oft times many things fall out between the cup and the lip
the moving finger writes and having writ moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all your tears wash out a word of it
the die is cast
the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge
call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
it is a wise father that knows his own child
a father is a banker provided by nature
the child is father of the man
there is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it ill behooves any of us to find fault with the rest of us
the greatest of faults i should say is to be conscious of none
the defects of great men are the consolation of the dunces
we keep on deceiving ourselves in regard to our faults until we at last come to look upon them as virtues
a fanatic is a man who consciously overcompensates a secret doubt
fear is the parent of cruelty
we must travel in the direction of our fear
once men are caught up in an event they cease to be afraid
only the unknown frightens men
people wish to learn to swim and at the same time to keep one foot on the ground
fear is not an unknown emotion to us
so let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance
i will show you fear in a handful of dust
fear of losing is what makes competitors so great
show me a gracious loser and ill show you a perennial loser
nothing in life is to be feared
it is only to be understood
nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear
just as courage imperils life fear protects it
fear comes from uncertainty
when we are absolutely certain whether of our worth or worthlessness we are almost impervious to fear
thus a feeling of utter unworthiness can be a source of courage
where no hope is left is left no fear
the human race is a race of cowards and i am not only marching in that procession but carrying a banner
men hesitate less to injure a man who makes himself loved than to injure one who makes himself feared for their love is held by a chain of obligation which because of mens wickedness is broken on every occasion for the sake of selfish profit but their fear is secured by a dread of punishment

horror is a feeling that cannot last long human nature is incapable of supporting it

a man who says he has never been scared is either lying or else hes never been any place or done anything
all men are afraid in battle

if any one attempts to haul down the american flag shoot him on the spot
when freedom from her mountain height unfurled her standard to the air she tore the azure robe of night and set the stars of glory there
cheers for the sailors that fought on the wave for it cheers for the soldiers that always were brave for it tears for the men that went down to the grave for it here comes the flag
the flag of our union forever

yes well rally round the flag boys well rally once again shouting the battlecry of freedom we will rally from the hillside well gather from the plain shouting the battlecry of freedom

rosered and bloodreed the stripes forever gleam snowwhite and soulwhite   the good forefathers dream skyblue and trueblue with stars to gleam aright   the gloried guidon of the day a shelter through the night
shoot if you must this old gray head but spare your countrys flag she said
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
men are like stone jugs  you may lug them where you like by the ears
a man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet
o that mens ears should be to counsel deaf but not to flattery

flowers may beckon towards us but they speak toward heaven and god
flowers are words which even a babe may understand
but neer the rose without the thorn
and i will make thee beds of roses and a thousand fragrant posies
consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin
flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
in flanders fields the poppies blow between the crosses row on row that mark our place and in the sky the larks still bravely singing fly scarce heard among the guns below
tis the last rose of summer
left blooming alone
where flowers degenerate man cannot live
of what are you afraid my child
inquired the kindly teacher
oh sir
the flowers they are wild replied the timid creature
if of thy mortal goods thou art bereft and from thy slender store two loaves alone to thee are left sell one and with the dole buy hyacinths to feed thy soul
say it with flowers
i sometimes think that never blows so red the rose as where some buried caesar bled that every hyacinth the garden wears dropt in her lap from some once lovely head
one thing is certain and the rest is lies the flower that once has blown for ever dies
when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd and the great star early droopd in the western sky the night i mournd  and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring
it is easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar
a fly sat on the chariot wheel and said what a dust i raise

all happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast
cheese  milks leap toward immortality
a gourmet is just a glutton with brains
vegetarianism is harmless enough though it is apt to fill a man with wind and selfrighteousness
if you wish to grow thinner diminish your dinner
to a man with an empty stomach food is god
hunger is the best sauce

if you ask the hungry man how much is two and two he replies four loaves
a good meal makes a man feel more charitable toward the whole world than any sermon
more die in the united states of too much food than of too little
a good meal ought to begin with hunger

but for them the rest of us could not succeed
here cometh april again and as far as i can see the world hath more fools in it than ever
a busy fool is fitter to be shut up than a downright madman
with stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain

every inch that is not fool is rogue
a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
he who lives without folly is not as wise as he thinks
the poor schlemiel is a man who falls on his back and breaks his nose
none but a fool worries about things he cannot influence
nature never makes any blunders when she makes a fool she means it
set a beggar on horseback and he will ride a gallop
it is said that a wise man who stands firm is a statesman and a foolish man who stands firm is a catastrophe

haint we got all the fools in town on our side
and aint that a big enough majority for any town
for gods sake give me the young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself
who loves not women wine and song remains a fool his whole life long
what is life but a series of inspired follies
the difficulty is to find them to do
there is no chance for old fools

you men think old men are fools but old men know young men are the fools
haint we got all the fools in town on our side
and aint that a big enough majority in any town

it is in the half fools and the half wise that the greatest danger lies
if you wish to avoid seeing a fool you must first break your lookingglass
the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
a fools bolt is soon shot
lord what fools these mortals be
he who thinks himself wise o heavens
is a great fool
the power that is supported by force alone will have cause often to tremble
force is allconquering but its victories are shortlived
force and not opinion is the queen of the world but it is opinion that uses the force
in life as in chess forethought wins
if a man take no thought about what is distant he will find sorrow near at hand
forethought we may have undoubtedly but not foresight
look ere thou leap see ere thou go
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel
and when he is out of sight quickly also he is out of mind
the world forgetting by the world forgot
there is no remembrance which time does not obliterate nor pain which death does not terminate

who is the forgotten man
he is the clean quiet virtuous domestic citizen who pays his debts and his taxes and is never heard of out of his little circle

the stupid neither forgive nor forget the naive forgive and forget the wise forgive but do not forget
forgetting is the cost of living cheerfully
forgiveness is the key to action and freedom
i can forgive but i cannot forget is only another way of saying i will not forgive
forgiveness ought to be like a canceled notetorn in two and burned up so that it never can be shown against one
life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrong
anger repressed can poison a relationship as surely as the crudest words
forgiveness means letting go of the past
i know now that patriotism is not enough i must have no hatred and bitterness toward anyone
stretch out your hand
let no human soul wait for a benediction
nobody ever forgets where he buried a hatchet
anger as soon as fed is dead tis starving makes it fat
once a woman has forgiven a man she must not reheat his sins for breakfast
theres no point in burying a hatchet if youre going to put up a marker on the site
as long as you dont forgive who and whatever it is will occupy a rentfree space in your mind
courage and clemency are equal virtues
one may have been a fool but theres no foolishness like being bitter
not the power to remember but its very opposite the power to forget is a necessary condition for our existence
once a woman has forgiven a man she must not reheat his sins for breakfast

a coward never forgave it is not in his nature
any man can seek revenge it takes a king or prince to grant a pardon
to be angry about trifles is mean and childish to rage and be furious is brutish and to maintain perpetual wrath is akin to the practice and temper of devils but to prevent and suppress rising resentment is wise and glorious is manly and divine
hatred is a death wish for the hated not a life wish for anything else
hatred is a passion requiring one hundred times the energy of love
keep it for a cause not an individual
keep it for intolerance injustice stupidity
for hatred is the strength of the sensitive
its power and its greatness depend on the selflessness of its use
resentment is the number one offender
it destroys more alcoholics than anything else
from it stem all forms of spiritual disease for we have been not only mentally and physically ill we have been spiritually sick
to oppose something is to maintain it
dwelling on the negative simply contributes to its power
to carry a grudge is like being stung to death by one bee
resentments are burdens we dont need to carry
the enslaver is enslaved the hater harmed
by putting his hand around my neck he slowly strangled himself
the one who deals the mortal blow receives the mortal wound
without forgiveness life is governed  by an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation
malice drinks onehalf of its own poison

hate is a prolonged form of suicide
hatred is like fireit makes even light rubbish deadly

whom they have injured they also hate
rage and bitterness do not foster femininity
they harden the heart and make the body sick
i used to store my anger and it affected my play
now i get it out
im never rude to my playing partner

the angry people are those people who are most afraid
anger as soon as fed is dead tis starving makes it fat
anger dwells only in the bosom of fools
anger and worry are the enemies of clear thought
holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned

something of vengeance i had tasted for the first time as aromatic wine it seemed on swallowing warm and racy its afterflavor metallic and corroding gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned
revenge could steal a mans life until there was nothing left but emptiness
revenge may not be a particularly high consciousnessoriented activity
the human heart in its perversity finds it hard to escape hatred and revenge
a man can lose sight of everything else when hes bent on revenge and it aint worth it
the whole human race loses by every act of personal vengeance
forgiveness is the sweetest revenge

to live in a harmonious balance of commitments and pleasures is what i strive for
yes there is a nirvanah it is in leading your sheep to a green pasture and in putting your child to sleep and in writing the last line of your poem
blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting
that daily life is really good one appreciates when one wakes from a horrible dream or when one takes the first outing after a sickness

we are never either so wretched or so happy as we say we are
the best things are nearest breath in your nostrils light in your eyes flowers at your feet duties at your hand the path of god just before you

adversity has the same effect on a man that severe training has on the pugilist it reduces him to his fighting weight
you will never be the person you can be if pressure tension and discipline are taken out of your life
some troubles like a protested note of a solvent debtor bear interest
failure changes for the better success for the worse
the basis of optimism is sheer terror
no evil is without its compensation  it is not the loss itself but the estimate of the loss that troubles us
let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course
give thanks for sorrow that teaches you pity for pain that teaches you courageand give exceeding thanks for the mystery which remains a mystery stillthe veil that hides you from the infinite which makes it possible for you to believe in what you cannot see
a christian could even give thanks for hell because hell was a threat and a warning to keep him in the right way
to every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage
too many people miss the silver lining because theyre expecting gold
if you count all your assets you always show a profit
too happy would you be did ye but know your own advantages
much unhappiness results from our inability to remember the nice things that happen to us
if we go down into ourselves we find that we possess exactly what we desire
be grateful for yourself be thankful
keep a grateful journal
every night list five things that you are grateful for
what it will begin to do is change your perspective of your day and your life
there is no wealth but life
just to be is a blessing
just to live is holy
life may be hard but its also wonderful
i like living
i have sometimes been wildly despairingly acutely miserable racked with sorrow but through it all i still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing
be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars
to be alive to be able to see to walk  its all a miracle
i have adapted the technique of living life from miracle to miracle
this is another day
are its eyes blurred with maudlin grief for any wasted past
a thousand thousand failures shall not daunt
let dust clasp dust death death i am alive
the mere sense of living is joy enough
however mean your life is meet it and live it do not shun it and call it hard names
it is not so bad as you are
it looks poorest when you are richest
the faultfinder will find faults even in paradise
love your life
life is the first gift love is the second and understanding the third
to have a full stomach and fixed income are no small things
for one mother joy is the quiet pleasure found in gently rubbing shampoo into her young childs hair
for another woman its taking a long walk alone while for yet another its reveling in a muchanticipated vacation
how can they say my life is not a success
have i not for more than sixty years gotten enough to eat and escaped being eaten
sunshine is delicious rain is refreshing wind braces us up snow is exhilarating there is really no such thing as bad weather only different kinds of good weather
only a stomach that rarely feels hungry scorns common things
my gratitude for good writing is unbounded im grateful for it the way im grateful for the ocean
is it so small a thing to have enjoyed the sun to have lived light in the spring to have loved to have thought to have done
when something does not insist on being noticed when we arent grabbed by the collar or struck on the skull by a presence or an event we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude
you say grace before meals
all right
but i say grace before the concert and the opera and grace before the play and pantomime and grace before i open a book and grace before sketching painting swimming fencing boxing walking playing dancing and grace before i dip the pen in the ink
thank god for dirty dishes they have a tale to tell
while other folks go hungry were eating pretty well
with home and health and happiness we shouldnt want to fuss for by this stack of evidence gods very good to us
it is strange what a contempt men have for the joys that are offered them freely
grateful for the blessing lent of simple tastes and mind content
an easy thing o power divine to thank thee for these gifts of thine for summers sunshine winters snow for hearts that kindle thoughts that glow but when shall i attain to this to thank thee for the things i miss
people call me an optimist but im really an appreciator  years ago i was cured of a badly infected finger with antibiotics when once my doctor could have recommended only a hot water soak or eventually surgery
when i was six years old and had scarlet fever the first of the miracle drugs sulfanilamide saved my life
im grateful for computers and photocopiers
i appreciate where weve come from
if only the people who worry about their liabilities would think about the riches they do possess they would stop worrying
would you sell both your eyes for a million dollars  or your two legs  or your hands  or your hearing
add up what you do have and youll find that you wont sell them for all the gold in the world
the best things in life are yours if you can appreciate yourself
we can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth and for the great benefits of our being our life health and reason we look upon ourselves as under no obligation
health is  a blessing that money cannot buy
happiness lies first of all in health
a sound mind in a sound body is a short but full description of a happy state in this world
health is the vital principle of bliss
if you cant be thankful for what you receive be thankful for what you escape
even though we cant have all we want we ought to be thankful we dont get all we deserve
happy the man who can count his sufferings
happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided
considering the fortune you might have lost youll have to admit youre rich already
i thank thee first because i was never robbed before second because although they took my purse they did not take my life third because although they took my all it was not much and fourth because it was i who was robbed and not i who robbed
think of the ills from which you are exempt
a man should always consider  how much more unhappy he might be than he is
the happiness of any given life is to be measured not by its joys and pleasures but by the extent to which it has been free from suffering from positive evil
better to suffer than to die
better a little fire to warm us than a great one to burn us
it isnt important to come out on top
what matters is to come out alive
he who limps still walks
i have gout asthma and seven other maladies but am otherwise very well
luckily i never feel at one time more than half my pains
pain is no longer pain when it is past
we are content to forgo joy when pain is also lost
the happiest is he who suffers the least pain the most miserable he who enjoys the least pleasure
happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind
the end of pain we take as happiness
you can be happy indeed if you have breathing space from pain
the summit of pleasure is the elimination of all that gives pain
i seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain
a prudent man will think more important what fate has conceded to him than what it has denied
it is better to be looked over than overlooked
blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting
he is a man of sense who does not grieve for what he has not but rejoices in what he has
enjoy the successes that you have and dont be too hard on yourself when you dont do well
too many times we beat up on ourselves
just relax and enjoy it
for everything you have missed you have gained something else
few love what they may have
the knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us
may we never let the things we cant have or dont have spoil our enjoyment of the things we do have and can have
it is not customary to love what one has
the talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have instead of what you dont have
happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetest
men  always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got
when we cannot get what we love we must love what is within our reach
take full account of the excellencies which you possess and in gratitude remember how you would hanker after them if you had them not
a wise man cares not for what he cannot have
a man can refrain from wanting what he has not and cheerfully make the best of a bird in the hand
long only for what you have
the tulip is among flowers what the peacock is among birds
a tulip lacks scent a peacock has an unpleasant voice
the one takes pride in its garb the other in its tail
slight not what is near though aiming at what is far
greediness of getting more deprives  the enjoyment of what it had got
there is a mortal breed most full of futility
in contempt of what is at hand they strain into the future hunting impossibilities on the wings of ineffectual hopes
what you really value is what you miss not what you have
while you fear missing a meal you arent fully aware of the meals you do eat
to be upset over what you dont have is to waste what you do have
if theres no bread cakes are very good
not what we have but what we enjoy constitutes our abundance
not what we have but what we use not what we see but what we choosethese are the things that mar or bless human happiness
the happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable
we always have enough to be happy if we are enjoying what we do have and not worrying about what we dont have
welcome everything that comes to you but do not long for anything else
the superiority of the distant over the present is only due to the mass and variety of the pleasures that can be suggested compared with the poverty of those that can at any time be felt
if there is a sin against life it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life
mankind by the perverse depravity of their nature esteem that which they have most desired as of no value the moment it is possessed and torment themselves with fruitless wishes for that which is beyond their reach
all your youth you want to have your greatness taken for granted when you find it taken for granted you are unnerved
do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for
it aint so much trouble to get rich as it is to tell when we have got rich
what you have become is the price you paid to get what you used to want
no man can be satisfied with his attainment although he may be satisfied with his circumstances
life is a progress from want to want not from enjoyment to enjoyment
we spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it
there must be more to life than having everything
is there no end to this escalation of desire
ambition has its disappointments to sour us but never the good fortune to satisfy us
there is no banquet but some dislike something in it
if we get everything that we want we will soon want nothing that we get
it matters very little whether a man is discontented in the name of pessimism or progress if his discontent does in fact paralyse his power of appreciating what he has got
the best things in life are appreciated most after they have been lost
only with a new ruler do you realize the value of the old
i remember those happy days and often wish i could speak into the ears of the dead the gratitude which was due to them in life and so illreturned
you cant appreciate home until youve left it money till its spent your wife till shes joined a womans club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town
birds sing after a storm why shouldnt people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them
think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy
oh my friend its not what they take away from you that countsits what you do with what you have left
god gave you a gift of 86400 seconds today
have you used one to say thank you
so long as we can lose any happiness we possess some
happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is
after my mothers death i began to see her as she had really been
it was less like losing someone than discovering someone
we never know the worth of water till the well is dry
the way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost
jesus please teach me to appreciate what i have before time forces me to appreciate what i had
eden is that oldfashioned house we dwell in every day without suspecting our abode until we drive away
generally the man with a good wife or the woman with a good husband or the children with good parents discover too late the goodness they overlooked while it was in full bloom
jesus please teach me to appreciate what i have before time forces me to appreciate what i had
the pilgrims made seven times more graves than huts
no americans have been more impoverished than these who nevertheless set aside a day of thanksgiving
the greatest saint in the world is not he who prays most or fasts most it is not he who gives alms or is most eminent for temperance chastity or justice
it is he who is most thankful to god
not what we say about our blessings but how we use them is the true measure of our thanksgiving
the unthankful heart discovers no mercies but the thankful heart will find in every hour some heavenly blessings
thanksgiving is a sure index of spiritual health
if the only prayer you say in your whole life is thank you that would suffice
who does not thank for little will not thank for much
the beginning of mens rebellion against god was and is the lack of a thankful heart
a thankful heart is not only the greatest virtue but the parent of all other virtues
seeds of discouragement will not grow in the thankful heart
the private and personal blessings we enjoythe blessings of immunity safeguard liberty and integrity deserve the thanksgiving of a whole life
one of lifes gifts is that each of us no matter how tired and downtrodden finds reasons for thankfulness
joy is the simplest form of gratitude
he who receives a benefit with gratitude repays the first installment on his debt
gratitude unlocks the fullness of life
it turns what we have into enough and more
it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity
it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend
gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
remember that not to be happy is not to be grateful
gratitude weighs heavy on us only when we no longer feel it
appreciation is yeast lifting ordinary to extraordinary
gratitude is the memory of the heart
one can never pay in gratitude one can only pay in kind somewhere else in life
silent gratitude isnt much use to anyone
happiness is itself a kind of gratitude
one cannot collect all the beautiful shells on the beach
a man who accustoms himself to buy superfluities is often in want of necessities
what is the proper limit for wealth
it is first to have what is necessary and second to have what is enough
he has enough who is contented with little
there is a great difference between satisfaction and satiation
more than enough is too much
its a grand thing to be able to take your money in your hand and to think no more of it when it slips away from you than you would a trout that would slip back into the stream
let him who has enough wish for nothing more
nothing is enough to the man for whom enough is too little
sufficiencys enough for men of sense
you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough
enough is as good as a feast
there is satiety in all things in sleep and lovemaking in the loveliness of singing and the innocent dance
the average man is rich enough when he has a little more than he has got
a wise man will desire no more than what he may get justly use soberly distribute cheerfully and leave contently
money and time are the heaviest burdens of life and the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use
whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough
too much is unwholesome
this only grant me that my means may lie too low for envy for contempt too high
moderation is the key to lasting enjoyment
nothing in excess
ask the gods nothing excessive
avarice is as destitute of what it has as poverty is of what it has not
philosophy  should not pretend to increase our present stock but make us economists of what we are possessed of
the use we make of our fortune determines as to its sufficiency
a little is enough if used wisely and too much is not enough if expended foolishly
it is possible to own too much
a man with one watch knows what time it is a man with two watches is never quite sure
happiness is a way station between too much and too little
to be able to dispense with good things is tantamount to possessing them
we dont need to increase our goods nearly as much as we need to scale down our wants
not wanting something is as good as possessing it
the hardest thing is to take less when you can get more
whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth is unhappy though he is master of the world
i have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires rather than in attempting to satisfy them
how few are our real wants and how easy is it to satisfy them
our imaginary ones are boundless and insatiable
of all the people in the world those who want the most are those who have the most
who covets more is evermore a slave
if you desire many things many things will seem but a few
the heart is great which shows moderation in the midst of prosperity
want is a growing giant whom the coat of have was never large enough to cover
freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired but by controlling the desire
how many things there are which i do not want
moderate desires constitute a character fitted to acquire all the good which the world can yield
he who has this character is prepared in whatever situation he is therewith to be content and has learned the science of being happy
were a man to order his life by the rules of true reason a frugal substance joined to a contented mind is for him great riches
one is never fortunate or as unfortunate as one imagines
man needs so little  yet he begins wanting so much
man never has what he wants because what he wants is everything
if your desires be endless your cares and fears will be so too
we are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier
he is not rich that possesses much but he that covets no more and he is not poor that enjoys little but he that wants too much
independence may be found in comparative as well as in absolute abundance i mean where a person contracts his desires within the limits of his fortune
one never hugs ones good luck so affectionately as when listening to the relation of some horrible misfortunes which has overtaken others
if you would but exchange places with the other fellow how much more you could appreciate your own position
we should learn by reflection on the misfortunes of others that there is nothing singular in those which befall ourselves
doubleno tripleour troubles and wed still be better off than any other people on earth
i wept because i had no shoes until i saw a man who had no feet
when lifes problems seem overwhelming look around and see what other people are coping with
you may consider yourself fortunate
if all misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion most people would be contented to take their own and depart
not he who has little but he who wishes more is poor
the covetous man is always poor
he is not poor that hath not much but he that craves much
he is poor who does not feel content
i have no riches but my thoughts
yet these are wealth enough for me
he who curbs his desires will always be rich enough
there is a gigantic difference between earning a great deal of money and being rich
that man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest
if you want an accounting of your worth count your friends
ive had an exciting life i married for love and got a little money along with it
true affluence is not needing anything
there are many excuses for the person who made the mistake of confounding money and wealth
like many others they mistook the sign for the thing signified
friends are the thermometer by which we may judge the temperature of our fortunes
to be satisfied with what one has that is wealth
as long as one sorely needs a certain additional amount that man isnt rich
i have the greatest of all riches that of not desiring them
my friends are my estate
a man is rich in proportion to the things he can afford to let alone
there are people who have money and people who are rich
he is rich that is satisfied
nor need we power or splendor wide hall or lordly dome the good the true the tenderthese form the wealth of home
he is well paid that is well satisfied
he who is content in his poverty is wonderfully rich
he who is contented is rich
a bmw cant take you as far as a diploma
all fortune belongs to him who has a contented mind
the greatest wealth is contentment with a little
no one has yet had the courage to memorialize his wealth on his tombstone
a dollar mark would not look well there
so many of us define ourselves by what we have what we wear what kind of house we live in and what kind of car we drive  if you think of yourself as the woman in the cartier watch and the hermes scarf a house fire will destroy not only your possessions but your self
the externals are simply so many props everything we need is within us
he is not rich that possesses much but he that is content with what he has
one wellcultivated talent deepened and enlarged is worth one hundred shallow faculties
if only every man would make proper use of his strength and do his utmost he need never regret his limited ability
anyone is to be pitied who has just sense enough to perceive his deficiencies
what strange perversity is it that induces a man to set his heart on doing those things which he has not succeeded in and makes him slight those in which his achievement has been respectable
i may not amount to much but at least i am unique
happy is the man who can do only one thing in doing it he fulfills his destiny
the real tragedy of life is not being limited to one talent but in failing to use that one talent
too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are
nothing will content him who is not content with a little
contentment is worth more than riches
i figure if i have my health can pay the rent and i have my friends i call it content
be content with what thou hast received and smooth thy frowning forehead
he is poor who does not feel content
if thou covetest riches ask not but for contentment which is an immense treasure
who is content with nothing possesses all things
my crown is called content a crown that seldom kings enjoy
it is right to be contented with what we have never with what we are
be content with your lot one cannot be first in everything
content may dwell in all stations
to be low but above contempt may be high enough to be happy
he is not rich that possesses much but he that is content with what he has
true contentment is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it
it is arduous and it is rare
poor and content is rich and rich enough
the greatest wealth is contentment with a little
and be content with such things as ye have
everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
try to live the life of the good man who is more than content with what is allocated to him
the world is full of people looking for spectacular happiness while they snub contentment
we are never content with our lot
until you make peace with who you are youll never be content with what you have
true contentment depends not upon what we have a tub was large enough for diogenes but a world was too little for alexander
to be content with little is difficult to be content with much impossible
reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has many not on your past misfortunes of which all men have some
no longer forward nor behind i look in hope or fear but grateful take the good i find the best of now and here
what a wonderful life ive had
i only wish id realized it sooner
was it always my nature to take a bad time and block out the good times until any success became an accident and failure seemed the only truth
most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted
there are men who are happy without knowing it
we are all of us richer than we think we are
what a miserable thing life is youre living in clover only the clover isnt good enough
i am convinced the longer i live that life and its blessings are not so entirely unjustly distributed as when we are suffering greatly we are inclined to suppose
life is hard
next to what
over a period of time its been driven home to me that im not going to be the most popular writer in the world so im always happy when anything in any way is accepted
it made me gladsome to be getting some education it being like a big window opening
too much of a good thing can be wonderful
a man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive
having been alive it wont be so hard in the end to lie down and rest
in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king
be satisfied and pleased with what thou art act cheerfully and well thou allotted part enjoy the present hour be thankful for the past and neither fear nor wish the approaches of the last
no one is satisfied with his fortune or dissatisfied with his intellect
tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
god pardons like a mother who kisses the offense into everlasting forgetfulness
good to forgive best to forget
it is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend
his heart was as great as the world but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong
bear and forbear
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us
to err is human to forgive divine
forgive others often yourself never
it is manlike to punish but godlike to forgive
fortune makes him fool whom she makes her darling
it is fortune not wisdom that rules mans life
fortune truly helps those who are of good judgment
the bitter dregs of fortunes cup to drain
fortunes made in no time are like shirts made in no time its ten to one if they hang long together
men are seldom blessed with good fortune and good sense at the same time
fortune and love befriend the bold
every man is the architect of his own fortune
o fortune fortune
all men call thee fickle
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
a sleeping fox counts hens in his dreams
frailty thy name is woman
an amiable weakness
forty million frenchmen cant be wrong
france freed from that monster bonaparte must again become the most agreeable country on earth
it would be the second choice of all whose ties of family and fortune give a preference to some other one and the first choice of all not under those ties
ye sons of france awake to glory
hark
hark
what myriads bid you rise
your children wives and grandsires hoary behold their tears and hear their cries
france always has plenty men of talent but it is always deficient in men of action and high character
the cause of freedom is the cause of god
life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy

a friend in power is a friend lost
a friend is one before whom i may think aloud
iron sharpeneth man so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend

if you want an accounting of your worth count your friends
a true friend is the best possession
best friend my wellspring in the wilderness
the only way to have a friend is to be one
a friend should be a master at guessing and keeping still
i have lost friends some by death  others by sheer inability to cross the street
faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
an old friend never can be found and nature has provided that he cannot easily be lost
one whos our friend is fond of us one whos fond of us isnt necessarily our friend
true friends  face in the same direction toward common projects interests goals

both within the family and without our sisters hold up our mirrors our images of who we are and of who we can dare to become
sisters define their rivalry in terms of competition for the gold cup of parental love
it is never perceived as a cup which runneth over rather a finite vessel from which the more one sister drinks the less is left over for the others

think up something appropriate and do it
loyalty is what we seek in friendship
true friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable
if two friends ask you to judge a dispute dont accept because you will lose one friend on the other hand if two strangers come with the same request accept because you will gain one friend

the condition which high friendship demands is the ability to do without it

think of all the women who passed up dessert on the titanic
everybody should believe in something i believe ill have another drink
i know lots more old drunks than old doctors

my doctor said i look like a million dollars  green and wrinkled
condoms arent completely safe
a friend of mine was wearing one


and got hit by a bus
my doctor gave me six months to live but when i couldnt pay the bill he gave me six months more
i cant believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm you were the quickest
i hope you live to be as old as your jokes
my wife is the most wonderful woman in the world and thats not just my opinion  its hers
she before we got married you told me you were welloff
he i was and i didnt know it
a good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband
why did god make man before he made woman

when all else is lost the future still remains
tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore and coming events cast their shadows before
i never think of the future
it comes soon enough
i know of no way of judging the future but by the past
the present is great with the future
trust no future howeer pleasant
let the dead past bury its dead
go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart
take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
there was the door to which i found no key there was the veil through which i might not see
there was a wise man in the east whose constant prayer was that he might see today with the eyes of tomorrow
i believe the future is only the past again entered through another gate
till the sun grows cold and the stars are old and the leaves of the judgment book unfold
the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong  but thats the way to bet
there is but one good throw upon the dice which is to throw them away
by gaming we lose both our time and treasure  two things most precious to the life of man
man is a gaming animal
keep flax from fire youth from gaming
it gaming is the child of avarice the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief
play out the game act well your part and if the gods have blundered we will not
business is more exciting than any game
divorce is a game played by lawyers
poetry is a mugs game
the game isnt over until its over
i never lost a game

most ball games are lost not won
in the game of life nothing is less important than the score at half time

a garden is a lovesome thing  god wot
rose plot fringed pool fern grot   the veriest school of peace and yet the fool contends that god is not
not god in gardens
when the sun is cool
nay but i have a sign
tis very sure god walks in mine
god the first garden made and the first city cain
the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
one is nearer gods heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth
the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits
the genius of einstein leads to hiroshima
genius in truth means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way
genius as such can neither be explained nor treated away only at times its delay and inhibition and its perversion to destructive or selfdestructive ends
to believe your own thought to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men  that is genius
doing easily what others find is difficult is talent doing what is impossible for talent is genius
it takes immense genius to represent simply and sincerely what we see in front of us
results
why man i have gotten a lot of results
i know several thousand things that wont work
the parting genius is with sighing sent
every man of genius is considerably helped by being dead
in the republic of mediocrity genius is dangerous
we define genius as the capacity for productive reaction against ones training
before i was a genius i was a drudge
in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty
genius develops in quiet places character out in the full current of human life
men of genius are the worst possible models for men of talent
the public is wonderfully tolerant
it forgives everything except genius
when a true genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign that the dunces are all in confederacy against him
talent is that which is in a mans power genius is that in whose power a man is
there is a thin line between genius and insanity
i have erased this line
improvement makes straight roads but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius
geniuses are the luckiest of mortals because what they must do is the same as what they most want to do
everyone is a genius at least once a year a real genius has his original ideas closer together
the true genius is a mind of large general powers accidentally determined to some particular direction
the mark of genius is an incessant activity of mind
genius is a spiritual greed
genius is an african who dreams up snow
sometimes men come by the name of genius in the same way that certain insects come by the name of centipede  not because they have a hundred feet but because most people cant count above fourteen
too often we forget that genius  depends upon the data within its reach that archimedes could not have devised edisons inventions
there is no great genius without a mixture of madness
genius is only great patience
genius is one per cent inspiration and ninetynine per cent perspiration
genius does what it must and talent does what it can
gift like genius i often think only means an infinite capacity for taking pains
genius is a promontory jutting out of the infinite
threefifths of him genius and twofifths sheer fudge
the lamp of genius burns quicker than the lamp of life
the poets scrolls will outlive the monuments of stone
the genius survives all else is claimed by death
a gentleman is man who can disagree without being disagreeable
the gentleman is a christian product
once a gentleman always a gentleman
propriety of manners and consideration for others are the two main characteristics of a gentleman
to make a fine gentleman several trades are required but chiefly a barber
let us put germany so to speak in the saddle
you will see that she can ride
we germans will never produce another goethe but we may produce another caesar
act decidedly and take the consequences
no good is ever done by hesitation
how lovely to think that no one need wait a moment we can start now start slowly changing the world
to know what has to be done then do it comprises the whole philosophy of practical life
if you want to do something do it
something must happen
putting off an easy thing makes it hard
putting off a hard thing makes it impossible
delay always breeds danger and to protract a great design is often to ruin it
the wise man does at once what the fool does finally
in putting off what one has to do one runs the risk of never being able to do it
getting an idea should be like sitting down on a pin it should make you jump up and do something
procrastination is opportunitys assassin
to do anything in this world worth doing we must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger but jump in and scramble through as well as we can
the man who will not execute his resolutions when they are fresh upon him can have no hope from them afterwards they will be dissipated lost and perish in the hurry and scurry of the world or sunk in the slough of indolence
why always not yet
do flowers in spring say not yet
we are very near to greatness one step and we are safe can we not take the leap
the keen spirit seizes the prompt occasion
the hour is ripe and yonder lies the way
delay not to seize the hour
i was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one
this one makes a net this one stands and wishes
would you like to make a bet which one gets the fishes
inspirations never go in for long engagements they demand immediate marriage to action
if we really want to live wed better start at once to try
the rewards in business go to the man who does something with an idea
the important thing is somehow to begin
eighty percent of success is showing up
as long as you can start you are all right
the juice will come
the way to get ahead is to start now
begin doing what you want to do now
it is no good hearing an inner voice or getting an inner prompting if you do not immediately act on that inner prompting
even if youre on the right track youll get run over if you just sit there
the first step is the hardest
the art of writing is the art of applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair
every beginning is hard
a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step
whenever you take a step forward you are bound to disturb something
if you miss the first buttonhole you will not succeed in buttoning up your coat
if you dont place your foot on the rope youll never cross the chasm
he who is outside the door has already a good part of his journey behind him
the beginning is half of every action
the man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones
everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was
change your life today
dont gamble on the future act now without delay
the most important thing about getting somewhere is starting right where we are
sometimes we look so intently toward the pinnacle that we stumble over the steps leading to it
development begins just where you are
few begin with anything like a clear view of what they want to do and the fortune they seek may come in a very different form from that which they have kept in view
the most effective way to do it is to do it
beginnings are apt to be shadowy
we will not know unless we begin
let us watch well our beginnings and results will manage themselves
you cannot contribute anything to the ideal condition of mind and heart known as brotherhood however much you preach posture or agree unless you live it
the secret of getting ahead is getting started
to always be intending to live a new life but never to find time to set about it this is as if a man should put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day and night to another till he is starved and destroyed
to choose is also to begin
knowing is not enough we must apply
willing is not enough we must do
wisdom is harder to do than it is to know
justice is a concept
muscle is the reality
no one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless
theres too much work to do
do noble things do not dream them all day long
that is the principal thing not to remain with the dream with the intention with the being in the mood but always forcibly to convert it into all things
dont wait for your ship to come in and feel angry and cheated when it doesnt
get going with something small
dont sit down and wait for the opportunities to come you have to get up and make them
the individual activity of one man with backbone will do more than a thousand men with a mere wishbone
with mere good intentions hell is proverbially paved
all the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action
it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility they must have action and they will have it if they cannot find it
now go take on the day
you cant steal second base and keep one foot on first
you cannot dream yourself into a character you must hammer and forge one for yourself
what the puritans gave the world was not thought but action
stagnation is something worse than death
it is corruption also
i myself must mix with action lest i wither by despair
psychology is action not thinking about oneself
the great end of life is not knowledge but action
the biggest sin is sitting on your ass
this is a world of action and not for moping and droning in
honors and rewards fall to those who show their good qualities in action
share the passion and action of your time at peril of being judged not to have lived
action is eloquence
the shortest answer is doing
the end of man is action
optimism unaccompanied by personal effort is merely a state of mind and not fruitful
to attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something while to secure it in this world we must do something
the only menace is inertia
one of the reasons why so few of us ever act instead of react is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses
if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake them up
men expect too much do too little
action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action
things dont turn up in this world until somebody turns them up
actact in the living present
life is essentially a series of events to be lived through rather than intellectual riddles to be played with and solved
there are risks and costs to a program of action
but they are far less than the longrange risks and costs of comfortable inaction
what you dont do can be a destructive force
he that is overcautious will accomplish little
untilled ground however rich will bring forth thistles and thorns so also the mind of man
often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision
the bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone
and all that you are sorry for is what you havent done
can anything be sadder than work unfinished
yes work never begun
the only things you regret are the things you didnt do
above all try something
to avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall
indifference and inaction must always pay a penalty
shun idleness
it is a rust that attaches itself to the most brilliant metals
i do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act but i do believe in a fate that falls on men unless they act
the real nature of an ethic is that it does not become an ethic unless and until it goes into action
for it isnt enough to talk about peace
one must believe in it
and it isnt enough to believe in it
one must work at it
words are mere bubbles of water but deeds are drops of gold
ef women want any rights moren dey got why dont dey jes take em and not be talkin about it
all talk of womens rights is moonshine
women have every right
they have only to exercise them
a man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
life is worth being lived but not worth being discussed all the time
action not words are the true criterion of the attachment of friends
words without actions are the assassins of idealism
if you have something to do that is worthwhile doing dont talk about it  do it
if deeds are wanting all words appear mere vanity and emptiness
talking is easy action difficult
ones feelings waste themselves in words they ought all to be distilled into action  which bring results
boast not of what thou wouldst have done but do
i like to deliver more than i promise instead of the other way around
when i talked no one listened to me
but as soon as i acted i became persuasive and i no longer find anyone incredulous
if you can talk brilliantly about a problem it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered
words gain credibility by deed
men are alike in their promises
it is only in their deeds that they differ
an acre of performance is worth a whole world of promise
well done is better than well said
our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them
we have too many sounding words and too few actions that correspond with them
activity in back of a very small idea will produce more than inactivity and the planning of a genius
when it comes to getting things done we need fewer architects and more bricklayers
get good counsel before you begin and when you have decided act promptly
ideas are one thing and what happens is another
thinking about swimming isnt much like actually getting in the water
actually getting in the water can take your breath away
all worthwhile men have good thoughts good ideas and good intentions but precious few of them ever translate those into action
a thought which does not result in an action is nothing much and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all
to think is easy
to act is difficult
to act as one thinks is the most difficult of all
unless a capacity for thinking be accompanied by a capacity for action a superior mind exists in torture
contemplation often makes life miserable
we should act more think less and stop watching ourselves live
what you theoretically know vividly realize
we must not waste life in devising means
it is better to plan less and do more
the best way to prepare for life is to begin to live
we are always getting ready to live but never living
action will remove the doubt that theory cannot solve
it is a common observation that those who dwell continually upon their expectations are apt to become oblivious to the requirements of their actual situation
he who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg
we dont have enough time to premeditate all our actions
the opportunity is often lost by deliberating
to think too long about doing a thing often becomes its undoing
do not wait for ideal circumstances nor the best opportunities they will never come
do what you can with what you have where you are
anything worth doing is worth doing too soon
now is the operative word
everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream
common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard but takes the one before it and plays the game
i dont wait for moods
you accomplish nothing if you do that
your mind must know it has got to get down to earth
my evil genius procrastination has whispered me to tarry til a more convenient season
i realize that if i wait until i am no longer afraid to act write speak be ill be sending messages on a ouija board cryptic complaints from the other side
he who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses
being unready and illequipped is what you have to expect in life
it is the universal predicament
it is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes
circumstances are seldom right
you never have the capacities the strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have
you must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen
he who hesitates is last
conditions are never just right
people who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing
you decide youll wait for your pitch
then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance
and then you think about your swing
and then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch
so what do we do
anything
something
so long as we just dont sit there
if we screw it up start over
try something else
if we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late
nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome
no age or time of life no position or circumstance has a monopoly on success
any age is the right age to start doing
everyone must row with the oars he has
the question for each man is not what he would do if he had the means time influence and educational advantages but what he will do with the things he has
how many opportunities come along
if you wait for the right one thats wrong because it may never be right and what have you got to lose
even if its a disaster youve tried youve learned something youve had an adventure
and that doesnt mean you cant do it again
and now lord what wait i for
we should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing
action always generates inspiration
inspiration seldom generates action
if you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street
the best place to succeed is where you are with what you have
one of these days is none of these days
who waits until the wind shall silent keep will never find the ready hour to sow
begin somewhere you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do
if you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured it may never arrive
mountains will not be climbed races won or lasting happiness achieved
there is nothing to be gained by waiting for a better situation
you see where you are and you do what you can with that
it is in your act that you exist not in your body
your act is yourself and there is no other you
the things people discard tell more about them than the things they keep
the test of any man lies in action
every action we take everything we do is either a victory or defeat in the struggle to become what we want to be
its where we go and what we do when we get there that tells us who we are
by his deeds we know a man
a human being has no discernible character until he acts
what we make is more important than what we are particularly if making is our profession
to do is to be
you cant build a reputation on what you intend to do
to be is to do
the way to do is to be
the ordinary man is involved in action the hero acts
an immense difference
we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done
our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds
the emotions are not always subject to reason  but they are always subject to action
when thoughts do not neutralize an undesirable emotion action will
silences have a climax when you have got to speak
he who desires but acts not breeds pestilence
when i am idle and shiftless my affairs become confused when i work i get results  not great results but enough to encourage me
to be busy with material affairs is the best preservative against reflection fears doubts  all these things which stand in the way of achievement
i suppose a fellow proposing to cut his throat would experience a sort of relief while occupied in stropping his razor carefully
acting can work a peculiar magic on the actor  it can cure you at least for the length of a performance of a whole variety of ailments
migraine headaches miserable colds or toothaches will suddenly disappear as youre up there going through your paces
it is only when i dally with what i am about look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward that i feel these cold sinkings of the heart
but the first broadside puts all to rights
action is the antidote to despair
action is the only reality not only reality but morality as well
performance releases pressure
wishing does not make a poor man rich
you cant get rich sitting on the bench
action makes more fortunes than caution
for purposes of action nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will
how then find the courage for action
by accepting the human condition more simply and candidly by dreading troubles less calculating less hoping more
necessity of action takes away the fear of the act
commitment leads to action
action brings your dream closer
one starts an action simply because one must do something
we couldnt possibly know where it would lead but we knew it had to be done
it is more blessed to give than to receive
you give but little when you give of your possessions
it is when you give of yourself that you truly give
i make presents to the mother but think of the daughter
give an inch hell take an ell
he gives twice who gives quickly
or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone
rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
i fear the greeks even when they bring gifts
behold i do not give lectures or a little charity when i give i give myself
there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory
the paths of glory lead but to the grave
mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the lord
o how quickly passes away the glory of the earth
one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name
god helps those who help themselves

promises that you make to yourself are often like the japanese plum treethey bear no fruit
i am not sending messages with my feet
all i ever wanted was not to come up empty
i did it for the dough and the old applause
first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
i can honestly say that i was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking
if i felt it was the right thing to do i was for it regardless of the possible outcome
what exactly is success
for me it is to be found not in applause but in the satisfaction of feeling that one is realizing ones ideal
we can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough

im not going to let my life revolve around losing weight
i have other things to do

he who hunts two hares leaves one and loses the other
he who serves two masters has to lie to one
all animals except man know that the ultimate of life is to enjoy it
what does socalled success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do

i take it as a prime cause of the present confusion of society that it is too sickly and too doubtful to use pleasure as a test of value
there is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval
life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time
all men seek one goal success or happiness
the goal of all civilization all religious thought and all that sort of thing is simply to have a good time
but man gets so solemn over the process that he forgets the end
the business of life is to enjoy oneself everything else is a mockery
the true object of human life is play
use your health even to the point of wearing it out
that is what it is for

not failure but low aim is a sin

my motto sans limites
a lot of young girls have looked to their career paths and have said theyd like to be chief
theres been a change in the limits people see
my father said dont grow up to be a woman and what he meant by that was a housewife  without any interests
our being is subject to all the chances of life
there are so many things we are capable of that we could be or do
the potentialities are so great that we never any of us are more than onefourth fulfilled
what else are we gonna live by if not dreams
we need to believe in something
what would really drive us crazy is to believe this reality we run into every day is all there is

people think that at the top there isnt much room
they tend to think of it as an everest

i never intended to become a runofthemill person
there is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best
too low they build who build beneath the stars
i have the same goal ive had ever since i was a little girl
i want to rule the world
your world is as big as you make it
whatever course you have chosen for yourself it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre
once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you
aim at heaven and you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither
i truly believe that before i retire from public office ill be voting for a woman for president
we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
if i smashed the traditions it was because i knew no traditions
aim at perfection in everything though in most things it is unattainable
however they who aim at it and persevere will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable
one may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low
shoot for the moon
even if you miss it you will land among the stars
we aim above the mark to hit the mark
every act hath some falsehood or exaggeration in it
life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries

i many not reach them but i can look up and see the beauty believe in them and try to follow where they lead
a mans worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions
not failure but low aim is crime
on the human chessboard all moves are possible
great is the road i climb but the garland offered by an easier effort is not worth the gathering

i took the position we were going to be a winning ball club
mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for
before you begin a thing remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead
you can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal
form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin
you have to erect a fence and say okay scale this
you can change your beliefs so they empower your dreams and desires
create a strong belief in yourself and what you want
man can only receive what he sees himself receiving
a person can grow only as much as his horizon allows
you must learn day by day year by year to broaden your horizon
the more things you love the more you are interested in the more you enjoy the more you are indignant about the more you have left when anything happens
enjoyment is not a goal it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity
what our deepest self craves is not mere enjoyment but some supreme purpose that will enlist all our powers and give unity and direction to our life
the very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose aiming at something outside self
the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose
there is more to life than just existing and having a pleasant time
happiness is not the end of life character is
many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness
it is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose
a good goal is like a strenuous exerciseit makes you stretch
its weak and despicable to go on wanting things and not trying to get them
growth is not concerned with itself
the selfconfidence one builds from achieving difficult things and accomplishing goals is the most beautiful thing of all
if ambition doesnt hurt you you havent got it
we need to restore the full meaning of that old word duty
it is the other side of rights
this is true joy of lifebeing used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a mighty one  instead of being a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy
that is happiness to be dissolved into something completely great
i looked on child rearing not only as a work of love and duty but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best i could bring to it
human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected
the measure of a life after all is not its duration but its donation
when we  devote ourselves to the strict and unsparing performance of duty ihen happiness comes of itself
duties are what make life most worth living
lacking them you are not necessary to anyone
seek happiness for its own sake and you will not find it seek for duty and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine
true happiness  is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose
the only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose
true happiness we are told consists in getting out of ones self but the point is not only to get out you must stay out and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand
happiness is the natural flower of duty
the happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good
the secret of living is to find  the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand
the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve
he who never sacrificed a present to a future good or a personal to a general one can speak of happiness only as the blind speak of color
there is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something
the fullgrown modern human being  is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment when he is consumed in the service of an idea in the conquest of the goal pursued
happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere wholeheartedly onedirectionally without regret or reservation
a mans happiness to do the things proper to man
happy the man who knows his duties
i believe half the unhappiness in life comes from people being afraid to go straight at things
happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal
give a man health and a course to steer and hell never stop to trouble about whether hes happy or not
having a goal is a state of happiness
happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort
without duty life is soft and boneless
never mind your happiness do your duty
i probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who by all laws of logic should never have made it
at each stage of my career i lacked the experience
the man who succeeds above his fellows is the one who early in life discerns his object and toward that object habitually directs his powers
even genius itself is but fine observation strengthened by fixity of purpose
if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours
a determinate purpose of life and steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages are indispensable conditions of success
the secret of success is constancy to purpose
the man who fails because he aims astray or because he does not aim at all is to be found everywhere
life has  taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors
she taught me to seek sustenance from the endeavor itself but to leave the result to god
the object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his
the object of war is to survive it

the most comprehensive formulation of therapeutic goals is the striving for wholeheartedness to be without pretense to be emotionally sincere to be able to put the whole of oneself into ones feelings ones work ones beliefs
i think the purpose of life is to be useful to be responsible to be honorable to be compassionate
it is after all to matter to count to stand for something to have made some difference that you lived at all
only when men are connected to large universal goals are they really happyand one result of their happiness is a rush of creative activity
the great business of life is to be to do to do without and to depart

lifes objective is life itself
i seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain
there are two things to aim at in life first to get what you want and after that to enjoy it
only the wisest of mankind achieve the second
i am searching for that which every man seekspeace and rest
reach high for stars lie hidden in your soul
dream deep for every dream precedes the goal
never undertake anything for which you wouldnt have the courage to ask the blessings of heaven
the one thing worth living for is to keep ones soul pure
the greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it
how to make god laugh
tell him your future plans
god enters by a private door into every individual
god gives the milk but not the pail
god himself is not secure having given man dominion over his work
god is a circle whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere
god is not dead but alive and well and working on a much less ambitious project
god pays but not weekly wages
god seems to have the receiver off the hook
god uses lust to impel men to marry ambition to office avarice to earning and fear to faith
god led me like an old blind goat
god will provide  if only god would provide until he provides
god when he makes the prophet does not unmake the man
he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
i wouldnt put it past god to arrange a virgin birth if he wanted to but i very much doubt if he would because it seems to be contrary to the way in which he deals with persons and brings his wonders out of natural personal relationships
if jesus was jewish how come he has a mexican name
in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is signed by gods name and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoever i go others will punctually come for ever and ever
the glory of god is in man fully alive
the vatican is against surrogate mothers

government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants
government is a trust and the officers of the government are trustees and both the trust and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people
though the people support the government the government should not support the people
i think we have more machinery of government than is necessary too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious
the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government and to protect its free expression should be our first object
govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish
dont overdo it
no man is good enough to govern another man without that others consent
a house divided against itself cannot stand  i believe this government cannot endure permanently halfslave and halffree

it seems to me that government is like a pump and what it pumps up is just what we are a fair sample of the intellect the ethics and the morals of the people no better no worse

o death where is thy sting
o grave where is thy victory
some village hampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood
the house appointed for all living
teach me to live that i may dread the grave as little as my bed
the temple of silence and reconciliation
dust into dust and under dust to lie sans wine sans song sans singer and  sans end
oh how a small portion of earth will hold us when we are dead who ambitiously seek after the whole world while we are living
is but the threshold of eternity
under the wide and starry sky dig the grave and let me lie
hark
from the tombs a doleful sound

moderation
small helpings
sample a little bit of everything

the mere sense of living is joy enough
the true way to soften ones troubles is to solace those of others
to complain that life has no joys while there is a single creature whom we can relieve by our bounty assist by our counsels or enliven by our presence is just as rational as to die of thirst with the cup in our hands
we learn the inner secret of happiness when we learn to direct our inner drives our interest and our attention to something besides ourselves
little deeds of kindness little words of love help to make earth happy like the heaven up above

if you have not often felt the joy of doing a kind act you have neglected much and most of all yourself
we cannot hold a torch to light anothers path without brightening our own

only from time to time through some experience that we have of our companion or through some remark that he passes he stands for a moment close to us as though illuminated by a flash of lightning
then we see him as he really is

the gobetween wears out a thousand sandals
life is livable because we know that wherever we go most of the people we meet will be restrained in their actions toward us by an almost instinctive network of taboos

humour is the first of the gifts to perish in a foreign tongue
the difficulty with humourists is that they will mix what they believe with what they dont whichever seems likelier to win an effect
the teller of a mirthful tale has latitude allowed him
we are content with less than absolute truth
he that jokes confesses
there are things of deadly earnest that can only be safely mentioned under cover of a joke
humour is the only test of gravity and gravity of humour for a subject which will not bear raillery is suspicious and a jest which will not bear serious examination is false wit
everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else
a satirist is a man who discovers unpleasant things about himself and then says them about other people
humour is emotional chaos remembered in tranquillity
the best definition of humour i know is humour may be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof
i think this is the best i know because i wrote it myself
a humorist is a man who feels bad but who feels good about it
humour plays close to the big hot fire which is the truth and the reader feels the heat
wit is the only wall between us and the dark
look at jewish history
unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable
so for every ten jews beating their breasts god designated one to be crazy and amuse the breastbeaters
by the time i was five i knew i was that one
mirthfulness is in the mind and you cannot get it out
it is just as good in its place as conscience or veneration
novelist peter de vries like adlai stevenson and mark twain has suffered from the american assumption that anyone with a sense of humour is not to be taken seriously
humour can be dissected as a frog can but the thing dies in the process
humour is the contemplation of the finite from the point of view of the infinite
the total absence of humour from the bible is one of the most singular things in all literature
laughter is the closest thing to the grace of god
humour is richly rewarding to the person who employs it
it has some value in gaining and holding attention
but it has no persuasive value at all
humour is the most engaging cowardice
with it myself i have been able to hold some of my enemy in play far out of gunshot
a comedian is a fellow who finds other comedians too humorous to mention
if its sanity youre after theres no recipe like laughter
laugh it off
humour is an affirmation of dignity a declaration of mans superiority to all that befalls him
comedy is simply a funny way of being serious
comedy is tragedy  plus time
caricature putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth
the ability to laugh at life is right at the top with love and communication in the hierarchy of our needs
humour has much to do with pain it exaggerates the anxieties and absurdities we feel so that we gain distance and through laughter relief
he deserves paradise who makes his companions laugh
laughter is the shortest distance between two people
you encourage a comic man too much and he gets silly
any man will admit if need be that his sight is not good or that he cannot swim or shoots badly with a rifle but to touch upon his sense of humour is to give him mortal affront
anything awful makes me laugh
i misbehaved once at a funeral
wit is far more often a shield than a lance
if theres anything i hate its the word humorist  i feel like countering with the word seriousist
a jests prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it
nonsense is an assertion of mans spiritual freedom in spite of all the oppressions of circumstance
humour is just another defence against the universe
the great humorist forgets himself in his delighted contemplation of other people
the role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds
laughter is the sensation of feeling good all over and showing it principally in one spot
he who laughs lasts
we are all here for a spell get all the good laughs you can
no one is more profoundly sad than he who laughs too much
a joke is an epigram on the death of a feeling
one loses so many laughs by not laughing at oneself
you can pretend to be serious but you cant pretend to be witty
charles dickens creation of mr pickwick did more for the elevation of the human race  i say it in all seriousness  than cardinal newmans lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom
newman only cried out for light in the gloom of a sad world
dickens gave it
the love of truth lies at the root of much humour
an empty stomach is not a good political adviser
if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat
a hungry people listens not to reason nor cares for justice nor is bent by any prayers
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
all husbands are alike but they have different faces so you can tell them apart
a good husband should be deaf and a good wife blind
a good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning
husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it
a man should be taller older heavier uglier and hoarser than his wife
men are april when they woo december when they wed
as the husband is the wife is
man is the only animal that can remain on friendly terms with the victims he intends to eat until he eats them
hypocrisy is the homage which vice pays to virtue
he that hath the name to be an early riser may sleep till noon
we are not hypocrites in our sleep
no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures
the wolf was sick he vowed a monk to be  but when he got well a wolf once more was he
remember this if you work for a man in heavens name work for him
if he pays you wages which supply you bread and butter work for him speak well of him stand by the institution he represents
if put to a pinch an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness
if you must vilify condemn and eternally disparage  resign your position and when you are on the outside damn to your hearts content but as long as you are part of the institution do not condemn it
for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible
the teeth are smiling but is the heart
affectation is a greater enemy to the face than smallpox
it is a trick among the dishonest to offer sacrifices that are not needed or not possible to avoid making those that are required
when you say that you agree to a thing in principle you mean that you have not the slightest intention of carrying it out
an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile  hoping it will eat him last
there is luxury in selfreproach
when we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has the right to blame us
extremes meet and there is no better example than the naughtiness of humility
hypocrite  mouth one way belly nother way
when the fox preaches look to your geese
i hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time
that would be hypocrisy
reasons are whores
saint abroad and a devil at home
every man is a hypocrite
hypocrites do the devils drudgery in christs livery
hypocrisy is the homage which vice renders to virtue
who stole the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in
i hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time
that would be hypocrisy
for parlour use the vague generality is a lifesaver
if anyone has a new idea in this country there are twice as many people who keep putting a man with a red flag in front of it
if you are possessed by an idea you find it expressed everywhere you even smell it
in a war of ideas it is people who get killed
to say that an idea is fashionable is to say i think that it has been adulterated to a point where it is hardly an idea at all
you cannot put a rope around the neck of an idea you cannot put an idea up against a barracksquare wall and riddle it with bullets you cannot confine it in the strongest prison cell that your slaves could ever build
great ideas are not charitable
for an idea ever to be fashionable is ominous since it must afterwards be always oldfashioned
every man with an idea has at least two or three followers
an idea is a feat of association and the height of it is a good metaphor
every time a man puts a new idea across he finds ten men who thought of it before he did  but they only thought of it
there is no adequate defence except stupidity against the impact of a new idea
no army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come
mans mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions
ideas wont keep something must be done about them

only the wise possess ideas the greater part of mankind are possessed by them
big ideas are so hard to recognize so fragile so easy to kill
dont forget that all of you who dont have them
great ideas originate in the muscles
the material universe exists only in the mind
ideas must work through the brains and the arms of good and brave men or they are no better than dreams

nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest without passion without business without entertainment without care
it is then that he recognizes that he is empty insufficient dependent ineffectual
from the depths of his soul now comes at once boredom gloom sorrow chagrin resentment and despair

did nothing in particular and did it very well
if a soldier or labourer complains of the hardship of his lot set him to do nothing
how beautiful it is to do nothing and then rest afterward
some people have a perfect genius for doing nothing and doing it assiduously
idleness is the holiday of fools
he is not only idle who does nothing but he is idle who might be better employed
for satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do

there is more stupidity around than hydrogen and it has longer shelf life
to be ignorant of ones ignorance is the malady of the ignorant
the trouble aint that people are ignorant its that they know so much that aint so
there is nothing more frightening than ignorance in action
when an idea is wanting a word can always be found to take its place
if ignorance is indeed bliss it is a very low grade of the article
not ignorance but ignorance of ignorance is the death of knowledge
ignoramus a person unacquainted with certain kinds of knowledge familiar to yourself and having certain other kinds that you know nothing about
ignorance is no excuse its the real thing
the good lord set definite limits on mans wisdom but set no limits on his stupidity  and thats just not fair
everybody is ignorant only on different subjects

little wit in the head makes much work for the feet
i am not ashamed to confess that i am ignorant of what i do not know
all ignorance toboggans into know and trudges up to ignorance again
the little i know i owe to my ignorance
it is a blind goose that cometh to the foxs sermon
and here poor fool with all my lore i stand no wiser than before
truth can be outraged by silence quite as cruelly as by speech
you can do one of two things just shut up which is something i dont find easy or learn an awful lot very fast which is what i tried to do
ignorance is no excuseits the real thing
my doctrine is this that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop and do nothing we make ourselves sharers in the guilt
whenever two good people argue over principles they are both right
progress results only from the fact that there are some men and women who refuse to believe that what they know to be right cannot be done
the wright brothers flew through the smoke screen of impossibility
most of the basic truths of life sound absurd at first hearing
the good thing about being young is that you are not experienced enough to know you cannot possibly do the things you are doing
the young do not know enough to be prudent and therefore they attempt the impossibleand achieve it generation after generation
sometimes it proves the highest understanding not to understand
aerodynamically the bumblebee shouldnt be able to fly but the bumble bee doesnt know it so it goes on flying anyway
lack of understanding is a great power
sometimes it enables men to conquer the world
an impossibility does not disturb us until its accomplishment shows what fools we were
once you start asking questions innocence is gone
god may have been waiting for centuries for somebody ignorant enough of the impossible to do that thing
to some people the impossible is impossible
some of my best friends are illusions
been sustaining me for years
great things are accomplished by those who do not feel the impotence of man
this  is a precious gift
at first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done then they begin to hope it can be done then they see it can be donethen it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago
ordinary people believe only in the possible
extraordinary people visualize not what is possible or probable but rather what is impossible
and by visualizing the impossible they begin to see it as possible
success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable
it is our duty as men and women to proceed as though limits to our abilities do not exist
so long as we think dugout canoes are the only possibilityall that is real or can be realwe will never see the ship we will never feel the free wind blow

people think the beatles know whats going on

i dont know what humor is
unprovided with original learning unformed in the habits of thinking unskilled in the arts of composition i resolved to write a book
when columbus started out he didnt know where he was going when he got there he didnt know where he was and when he got back he didnt know where he had been
all i know about humor is that i dont know anything about it
it is a sign of strength not of weakness to admit that you dont know all the answers
i learn by going where i have to go
whatever people in general do not understand they are always prepared to dislike the incomprehensible is always the obnoxious
one learns by doing the thing for though you think you know it you have no certainty until you try

he wasnt there again today

the task of the real intellectual consists of analyzing illusions in order to discover their causes
an illusion which makes me happy is worth a verity which drags me to the ground
we must select the illusion which appeals to our temperament and embrace it with passion if we want to be happy
winston churchill is always expecting rabbits to come out of an empty hat
reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving
every real object must cease to be what it seemed and none could ever be what the whole soul desired
aspects are within us and who seems most kingly is king
those who lose dreaming are lost
it is dangerous to let the public behind the scenes
they are easily disillusioned and then they are angry with you for it was the illusion they loved
a rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it bearing within him the image of a cathedral

fools act on imagination without knowledge pedants act on knowledge without imagination
from ghoulies and ghosties and longleggedy beasties and things that go bump in the night good lord deliver us
i admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing but if we are to give everything its due twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too
inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced
it was a year when frankie thought about the world
and she did not see it as a round school globe with the countries neat and differentcoloured
she thought of the world as huge and cracked and loose and turning a thousand miles an hour
saddle your dreams afore you ride em
the eyes are not responsible when the mind does the seeing
were it not for imagination a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a duchess
imagination grows by exercise and contrary to common belief is more powerful in the mature than in the young
the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain
his imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich
it enabled him to run though not to soar
imagination is the eye of the soul
imagination is a poor substitute for experience
imagination frames events unknown in wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin and what it fears creates
reason respects the differences and imagination the similitudes of things
the sky is the daily bread of the eyes
let us leave pretty women to men without imagination
to make a prairie it takes clover and one bee one clover and a bee and revery the revery alone will do if bees are few

imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty justice and happiness which is everything in this world
most people go on living their everyday life frightened half indifferent they behold the ghostly tragicomedy that has been performed on the international stage before the eyes and ears of the world
we are in truth more than a half of what we are by imitation
when people are free to do as they please they usually imitate each other
almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble
there is a difference between imitating a good man and counterfeiting him
every man is a borrower and a mimic life is theatrical and literature a quotation
we do not imitate but are a model to others
the crow that mimics a cormorant gets drowned
we love in others what we lack ourselves and would be everything but what we are
immature poets imitate mature poets steal
agesilaus the spartan king was once invited to hear a mimic imitate the nightingale but declined with the comment that he had heard the nightingale itself
fewer things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
it is impossible to imitate voltaire without being voltaire
he who imitates what is evil always goes beyond the example that is set on the contrary he who imitates what is good always falls short
a good imitation is the most perfect originality
what is human is immortal
a good man never dies
i have been dying for twenty years now i am going to live
immortality is the glorious discovery of christianity
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
oh may i join the choir invisible of those immortal dead who live again
life is the childhood of our immortality
the nearer i approach the end the plainer i hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me
it is marvelous yet simple
our hope of immortality does not come from any religion but nearly all religions come from that hope
i wish to believe in immortality  i wish to live with you forever
no one could ever meet death for his country without the hope of immortality
there is no death
the stars go down to rise upon some fairer shore
for tho from out our bourne of time and place the flood may bear me far i hope to see my pilot face to face when i have crost the bar
never did christ utter a single word attesting to a personal resurrection and a life beyond the grave

the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it
you cannot make a crab walk straight
you cant get blood out of a turnip
you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear
few things are impossible to diligence and skill
never let me hear that foolish word again
impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of fools
to the timid and hesitating everything is impossible because it seems so
it is necessary to try to surpass ones self always this occupation ought to last as long as life
people seldom improve when they have no other model but themselves to copy after
slumber not in the tents of your fathers
the world is advancing
advance with it

can anything be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve them ones self
voyager upon lifes sea   to yourself be true and whateer your lot may be paddle your own canoe
i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than to be crowded on a velvet cushion
lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have
there is nothing harder than the softness of indifference
communists have committed great crimes but at least they have not stood aside like an established society and been indifferent
i would rather have blood on my hands than water like pilate
hate is not the opposite of love apathy is
what makes life dreary is want of motive
the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crisis maintain their neutrality
once conform once do what others do because they do it and a kind of lethargy steals over all the finer senses of the soul
not to he who is offensive to us are we most unfair but to he who does not concern us at all
most of us have no real loves and no real hatreds
blessed is love less blessed is hatred but thrice accursed is that indifference which is neither one nor the other
the only menace is inertia
tolerance is a tremendous virtue but the immediate neighbours of tolerance are apathy and weakness
the true opposite of love is not hate but indifference
hate bad as it is at least treats the neighbour as a thou whereas indifference turns the neighbour into an it a thing
this is why we may say that there is actually one thing worse than evil itself and that is indifference to evil
in human relations the nadir of morality the lowest point as far as christian ethics is concerned is manifest in the phrase t couldnt care less
if moderation is a fault then indifference is a crime
indifference may not wreck a mans life at any one turn but it will destroy him with a kind of dryrot in the long run
an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man
every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not
the worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might
the more we do the more we can do the more busy we are the more leisure we have
in this theater of mans life it is reserved only for god and angels to be lookers on
i am a part of all that i have met
the humblest individual exerts some influence either for good or evil upon others
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
a woman is more influenced by what she divines than by what she is told
if the nose of cleopatra had been shorter the whole face of the earth would have been changed
thou wert my guide philosopher and friend
we set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us
brutes leave ingratitude to man
this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arm quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart
do you know what is more hard to bear than the reverses of fortune
it is the baseness the hideous ingratitude of man
the injury we do and the one we suffer are not weighed in the same scales
recompense injury with justice and recompense kindness with kindness
if the other person injures you you may forget the injury but if you injure him you will always remember
in an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared
there is no ghost so difficult to lay as the ghost of an injury
there is but one blasphemy and that is injustice
he who commits injustice is ever made more wretched than he who suffers it
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it
then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children
the truly innocent are those who not only are guiltless themselves but who think others are
the innocent is the person who explains nothing
whoever blushes is already guilty true innocence is ashamed of nothing
through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbours
as innocent as a newlaid egg
had laws not been we never had been blamd for not to know we sinnd is innocence
good is when i steal other peoples wives and cattle bad is when they steal mine
it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer
as innocent as a newlaid egg
they that know no evil will suspect none
innocence finds not near so much protection as guilt
no excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness
mad as a march hare
i teach that all men are mad
insanity in individuals is something rare  but in groups parties nations and epochs it is the rue
that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true
whom jupiter would destroy he first drives mad
though this be madness yet there is method in t
no man was ever great without a touch of divine afflatus
a writer is rarely so well inspired as when he talks about himself
inspiration and genius  one and the same
every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life
never let go of that fiery sadness called desire
for every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing
the moment somebody says to me this is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me
discontent is the first step in progress
no one knows what is in him till he tries and many would never try if they were not forced to
all progress is based upon a universal innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income
it is the spur of ignorance the consciousness of not understanding and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress
one starts an action simply because one must do something
what you are must always displease you if you would attain to that which you are not
if youre good to your staff when things are going well theyll rally when times go bad
praise out of season or tactlessly bestowed can freeze the heart as much as blame
the pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real

trust your own instinct
your mistakes might as well be your own instead of someone elses
i feel there are two people inside of meme and my intuition
if i go against her shell screw me every time and if i follow her we get along quite nicely
i give myself sometimes admirable advice but i am incapable of taking it
some of the finest moral intuitions come to quite humble people
the visiting of lofty ideas doesnt depend on formal schooling
think of those galilean peasants
im the foe of moderation the champion of excess
if i may lift a line from a diehard whose identity is lost in the shuffle id rather be strongly wrong than weakly right
conviction without experiences makes for harshness
without fanaticism we cannot accomplish anything
to have character is to be big enough to take life on
the trouble is that not enough people have come together with the firm determination to live the things which they say they believe
all i can do is act according to my deepest instinct and be whatever i must becrazy or ribald or sad or compassionate or loving or indifferent
that is all anybody can do
instinct is untaught ability
trusting our intuition often saves us from disaster
trust your gut
it is our business to go as we are impelled
intuition  appears to be the extrasensory perception of reality
common sense is instinct
enough of it is genius
a goose flies by a chart which the royal geographical society could not improve
i go by instinct

i dont worry about experience
unconsciousness spontaneity instinct  hold us to the earth and dictate the relatively good and useful
every time you dont follow your inner guidance you feel a loss of energy loss of power a sense of spiritual deadness
every time a resolve or fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing fruit it is worse than a chance lost it works to hinder future emotions from taking the normal path of discharge
it is only by following your deepest instinct that you can lead a rich life
instinct is the nose of the mind
one of the reasons why so few of us ever act instead of react is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses
a man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them for they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world
if you let your fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct your life will be safe expedient and thin
everyone was searching for a formula for survival and the only formula that worked was no formula
instinct  thats all you had to go on
i feel there are two people inside meme and my intuition
if i go against her shell screw me every time and if i follow her we get along quite nicely
to be faithful to your instincts and the impulses that carry you in the direction of the excellence you most desire and value  surely that is to lead the noble life
we each need to let our intuition guide us and then be willing to follow that guidance directly and fearlessly
by learning to contact listen to and act on our intuition we can directly connect to the higher power of the universe and allow it to become our guiding force
the struggle to learn to listen to and respect our own intuitive inner promptings is the greatest challenge of all
once you get rid of the idea that you must please other people before you please yourself and you begin to follow your own instinctsonly then can you be successful
you become more satisfied and when you are other people tend to be satisfied by what you do
if you do not express your own original ideas if you do not listen to your own being you will have betrayed yourself
every human being has like socrates an attendant spirit and wise are they who obey its signals
if it does not always tell us what to do it always cautions us what not to do
trust the instinct to the end though you can render no reason
the truth of a thing is the feel of it not the think of it
spend time every day listening to what your muse is trying to tell you
when i do things without any explanation but just with spontaneity
i can be sure that i am right
analysis kills spontaneity
the grain once ground into flour germinates no more
spontaneity is the quality of being able to do something just because you feel like it at the moment of trusting your instincts of taking yourself by surprise and snatching from the clutches of your wellorganized routine a bit of unscheduled pleasure
i never believe facts canning said nothing was so fallacious as facts except figures
trust your hunches
hunches are usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level
warning
do not confuse your hunches with wishful thinking
this is the road to disaster
facts are not truths they are not conclusions they are not even premisses but in the nature and parts of premisses
statistics are no substitute for judgement
you cannot know what you cannot feel
we should chiefly depend not upon that department of the soul which is most superficial and fallible our reason but upon that department that is deep and sure which is instinct
i make all my decisions on intuition
i throw a spear into the darkness
that is intuition
then i must send an army into the darkness to find the spear
that is intellect
instinct is intelligence incapable of selfconsciousness
every advance in social progress removes us more and more from the guidance of instinct obliging us to depend upon reason for the assurance that our habits are really agreeable to the laws of health
follow your instincts
thats where true wisdom manifests itself
impulse without reason is not enough and reason without impulse is a poor makeshift
the shrewd guess the fertile hypothesis the courageous leap to a tentative conclusionthese are the most valuable coin of the thinker at work
a trembling in the bones may carry a more convincing testimony than the dry documented deductions of the brain
calculation never made a hero
we are so clothed in rationalization and dissemblance that we can recognize but dimly the deep primal impulses that motivate us
all our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling
reason ruling alone is a force confining and passion unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction
modern mans besetting temptation is to sacrifice his direct perceptions and spontaneous feelings to his reasoned reflections to prefer in all circumstances the verdict of his intellect to that of his immediate intuitions
decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because i know that i will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me i should do
systems die instincts remain
i do not believe that the deeper problems of living can ever be answered by the process of thought
i believe that life itself teaches us either patience with regard to them or reveals to us possible solutions when our hearts are pressed close against duties and sorrows and experiences of all kinds
life is one long struggle between conclusions based on abstract ways of conceiving cases and opposite conclusions prompted by our instinctive perception of them
nothing reaches the intellect before making its appearance in the senses
instinct guides the animal better than the man
in the animal it is pure in man it is led astray by his reason and intelligence
ideas pull the trigger but instinct loads the gun
wellbred instinct meets reason halfway
good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out
pure logic is the ruin of the spirit
when a man begins to reason he ceases to feel
a mind all logic is like a knife all blade
it makes the hand bleed that uses it
the mind can assert anything and pretend it has proved it
my beliefs i test on my body on my intuitional consciousness and when i get a response there then i accept
people who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind
the brain is not and cannot be the sole or complete organ of thought and feeling
imagination is more important than knowledge
some other faculty than the intellect is necessary for the apprehension of reality
command by instinct is swifter subtler deeper more accurate more in touch with reality than command by conscious mind
the discovery takes ones breath away
no one is more liable to make mistakes than the man who acts only on reflection
nothing is impossible when we follow our inner guidance even when its direction may threaten us by reversing our usual logic
a true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the results of sudden impulses and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast
it is wisdom to believe the heart
i follow my heart for i can trust it
the intellect is always fooled by the heart
there are no rules
just follow your heart
man becomes man only by his intelligence but he is man only by his heart
it is the heart always that sees before the head can see
it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
great thoughts always come from the heart
it is the heart which experiences god not the reason
the heart has reasons which reason cannot understand
in making our decisions we must use the brains that god has given us
but we must also use our hearts which he also gave us
just be what you are and speak from your guts and heartits all a man has
when love is not madness it is not love
to live is like to love all reason is against it and all healthy instinct is for it
the thinker philosophizes as the lover loves
even were the consequences not only useless but harmful he must obey his impulse
what you intuitively desire that is possible to you
falling in love is one of the activities forbidden that tiresome person the consistently reasonable man
if you really want something you can figure out how to make it happen
our real duty is always found running in the direction of our worthiest desires
the essential conditions of everything you do must be choice love passion
passion and prejudice govern the world only under the name of reason
the conclusions of passion are the only reliable ones
man is a passion which brings a will into play which works an intelligence
life is not governed by will or intention
life is a question of nerves and fibers and slowly builtup cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams
we do not wish ardently for what we desire only through reason
trust your hunches
theyre usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level
inspiration does not come like a bolt nor is it kinetic energy striving but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time
intuition is given only to him who has undergone long preparation to receive it
you must train your intuitionyou must trust the small voice inside you which tells you exactly what to say what to decide
you have first an instinct then an opinion then a knowledge as the plant has root bud and fruit
trust the instinct to the end though you can render no reason
a hunch is creativity trying to tell you something
i move on feeling and have learned to distrust those who dont
advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didnt
instinct is a powerful form of natural energy perhaps comparable in humans to electricity or even atomic energy in the mechanical world
cherish your emotions and never undervalue them
but are not this struggle and even the mistakes one may make better and do they not develop us more than if we kept systematically away from emotions
many a man gets weary of clamping down on his rough impulses which if given occasional release would encourage the living of life with salt in it in place of dust
we shall keep our horizon perfectly absolutely crystallinely open ready every day for the scouring gales of impulse
intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain but simply points the way
every time ive done something that doesnt feel right its ended up not being right
none of us can estimate what we do when we do it from instinct
i write out of instinct
the way to procure insults is to submit to them
a man meets with no more respect than he exacts
thou hast added insult to injury
it is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it



twill turn your eyeballs black and blue
injuries may be forgiven but not forgotten
it seldom pays to be rude
it never pays to be only halfrude
lloyd george could not see a belt without hitting below it
macaulay is well for awhile but one wouldnt live under niagara
be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny
a fly sir may sting a stately horse and make him wince but one is but an insect and the other a horse still
calumny is only the noise of madmen
to persevere in ones duty and be silent is the best answer to calumny
woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you
young men soon give and soon forget affronts old age is slow in both
as long as there are readers to be delighted with calumny there will be found reviewers to calumniate
he that flings dirt at another dirtieth himself most
it takes your enemy and your friend working together to hurt you to the heart the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you
calumny requires no proof
the throwing out of malicious imputations against any character leaves a stain which no afterrefutation can wipe out
to create an unfavourable impression it is not necessary that certain things should be true but that they have been said
it is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it
abuse a man unjustly and you will make friends for him
one of the surest signs of the philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down
alive ridiculous and dead forgot
ill give you an idea of what kind of a guy he was
st francis would have punched him in the mouth
he loves to eat  he puts mayonnaise on an aspirin
apparently he was not the sharpest quill on the porcupine if you get my drift
you might say he was one taco short of a combination platter
i cant believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm you were the quickest
cheap
if he was at the last supper he would have asked for separate checks
ive just learned about his illness lets hope its nothing trivial
why does our host always have tears in his eyes after sex
due to the pepper spray
i take him to mcdonalds just to watch him eat and see the numbers change
mr attlee is a very modest man
but then he has much to be modest about
after a year of therapy my psychiatrist said to me maybe life isnt for everyone
the only way she could get a standing ovation would be if she sang the starspangled banner
his voice is to entertainment what the kazoo is to classical music
some people can carry a tune but they seem to stagger under the load
every word she writes is a lie including and and the
when she told her doctor that she always wanted to keep her weight exactly the same as her iq he gave her a lecture on anorexia
i hope you live to be as old as your jokes
if he can remember so many jokes with all the details that mold them why cant he recall with equal skill all the times he told them
i just thought you might like to know that i passed a kennel on the way to the game and your mother is all right
heres a good rule of thumb too clever is dumb
we should take care not to make the intellect our god it has of course powerful muscles but no personality
the intellect is always fooled by the heart
the job of intellectuals is to come up with ideas and all weve been producing is footnotes
lord birkenhead is very clever but sometimes his brains go to his head
all zeal runs down
what replaces it
intellectualism
will and intellect are one and the same thing
the highest intellects like the tops of mountains are the first to catch and to reflect the dawn
an intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself
i hate intellectuals
they are from the top down
i am from the bottom up
think sideways
a conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking
the brain is the citadel of sense perception
my body has certainly wandered a good deal but i have an uneasy suspicion that my mind has not wandered enough
there are innumerable instances suggesting that modern intellectuals do not believe themselves that they dont really believe what they say that they say certain things only in order to assure themselves that they possess opinions and ideas that are different from those that are entertained by the common herd of men
intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain but simply points the way
the intellect of man is forced to choose perfection of the life or of the work
an intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows
the common sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses
intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct from ability which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended
intuition becomes increasingly valuable in the new information society precisely because there is so much data
the unluckiest insolvent in the world is the man whose expenditure is too great for his income of ideas
to the good listener half a word is enough
time has a way of demonstrating


the most stubborn are the most intelligent
intelligence must follow faith never precede it and never destroy it
intelligence is derived from two words  inter and legere  inter meaning between and legere meaning to choose
an intelligent person therefore is one who has learned to choose between
he knows that good is better than evil that confidence should supersede fear that love is superior to hate that gentleness is better than cruelty forbearance than intolerance compassion than arrogance and that truth has more virtue than ignorance
one of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence
the intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like the condemned man who is proud of his large cell
the sign of an intelligent people is their ability to control emotions by the application of reason
never tell people how to do things
tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity
i not only use all the brains i have but all i can borrow
intelligence is not all that important in the exercise of power and is often in point of fact useless
just as a leader doesnt need intelligence a man in my job doesnt need too much of it either
the cuckoo who is on to himself is halfway out of the clock
ive had a lot of experience with people smarter than i am
all the crimes on earth do not destroy so many of the human race nor alienate so much property as drunkenness
bacchus has drowned more men than neptune
of all calamities this is the greatest
the smaller the drink the clearer the head
drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness
o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains
that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
the devil loves nothing better than the intolerance of reformers
it were better to be of no church than to be bitter for any
to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance
he that falls in love with himself will have no rivals
love yourself first and everything else falls into line
never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel for love is not ours to command
perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state
being in love shows a person who he should be
the love of liberty is the love of others the love of power is the love of ourselves
love is like playing the piano
first you must learn to play by the rules then you must forget the rules and play from your heart
love grows by giving
the love we give away is the only love we keep
the only way to retain love is to give it away
without love benevolence becomes egotism
you cannot be lonely if you like the person youre alone with
relish love in your old age
aged love is like aged wine it becomes more satisfying more refreshing more valuable more appreciated and more intoxicating
guard within yourself that treasure kindness
know how to give without hesitation how to lose without regret how to acquire without meanness know how to replace in your heart by the happiness of those you love the happiness that may be wanting to yourself
if it is a virtue to love my neighbor as a human being it must be a virtue  and not a vice  to love myself since i am a human being too
since love grows within you so beauty grows
for love is the beauty of the soul
selflove my liege is not so vile a sin as selfneglecting
out of love you can speak with straight fury
whateer th almightys subsequent command his first command is this  man love thyself
selflove seems so often unrequited
love is above all else the gift of oneself
a heart that loves is always young
who so loves believes the impossible
accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you together but do so with all your heart
have you ever been at sea in a dense fog when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship tense and anxious groped her way toward the shore with plummet and soundingline and you waited with beating heart for something to happen
i was like that ship before my education began only i was without compass or sounding line and no way of knowing how near the harbor was
light
give me light
was the wordless cry of my soul and rhe light of love shone on me in that very hour
love can be understood only from the inside as a language can be understood only by someone who speaks it as a world can be understood only by someone who lives in it
want the mistress of invention
a tool is but the extension of a mans hand and a machine is but a complex tool
and he that invents a machine augments the power of a man and the wellbeing of mankind
god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions
when erin first rose from the darkswelling flood god blessed the green island he saw it was good
the emerald of europe it sparkled and shone in the ring of this world the most precious stone
whether on the scaffold high
or on the battlefield we die oh what matter when for erin dear we fall
you may have the universe if i may have italy
open my heart and you will see graved inside of it italy
beyond the alps lies italy
on desperate seas long wont to roam thy hyacinth hair they classic face thy naiad airs have brought me home to the glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome
my soul today is far away sailing the vesuvian bay
he that is not jealous is not in love
in jealousy there is more selflove than love
jealousy is an awkward homage which inferiority renders to merit
o jealousy
thou magnifier of trifles
jealousys eyes are green
a man who could make so vile a pun would not scruple to pick a pocket
many a true word is spoken in jest
alas poor yorick
i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy
jesters do often prove prophets
the jews were gods chosen people
i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great
to undo a jew is charity and not sin
it is not possible for christians to take part in antisemitism
we are semites spiritually
i am a jew hath not a jew eyes
hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions
fed with die same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian is
neither cast ye your pearls before swine
pearl of great price
journalism has already come to be the first power in the land
get your facts first and then you can distort em as much as you please
burke said there were three estates in parliament but in the reporters gallery yonder there sat a fourth estate more important far than they all
writing good editorials is chiefly telling the people what they think not what you think
the best use of a journal is to print the largest practical amount of important truth  truth which tends to make mankind wiser and thus happier
every newspaper editor owes tribute to the devil
i fear three newspapers more than a hundred thousand bayonets
we live under a government of men and morning newspapers
the newspapers
sir they are the most villainous   licentious  abominable  infernal  not that i ever read them  no  i make it a rule never to look into a newspaper
i wish you all the joy that you can wish

it is better that a judge should lean on the side of compassion than severity
a daniel come to judgment
yea a daniel
o wise young judge how i do honor thee
let the judges answer to the question of law and the jurors to the matter of fact
the cold neutrality of an impartial judge
judges are but men and are swayed like other men by vehement prejudices
this is corruption in reality give it whatever other name you please
judges are apt to be naive simpleminded men
thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves
four things belong to a judge to hear courteously to answer wisely to consider soberly and to decide impartially
thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting
one mans word is no mans word we should quietly hear both sides
forbear to judge for we are sinners all
i know of no way of judging the future but by the past
we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done
give your decision never your reasons your decisions may be right your reasons are sure to be wrong
judge not that ye be not judged
give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
o judgment
thou are fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason
one cool judgment is worth a thousand hasty councils
the thing to do is to supply light and not heat
are you good men and true
the jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty and a premium upon ignorance stupidity and perjury
the jury passing on the prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try
it is always wise as it is also fair to test a man by the standards of his own day and not by those of another
the strictest justice is sometimes the greatest injustice
injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice
men are not hanged for stealing horses but that horses may not be stolen
a fox should not be on the jury at a gooses trial
thwackum was for doing justice and leaving mercy to heaven
the courts authority  possessed of neither the purse nor the sword ultimately rests on substantial public confidence in its moral sanctions
charity is no substitute for justice withheld
i would remind you that extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice
and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
neer of the living can the living judge  too blind the affection or too fresh the grudge
i always felt from the beginning that you had to defend people you disliked and feared as well as those you admired
this is a court of law young man not a court of justice
the whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when nations are strong they are not always just and when they wish to be just they are no longer strong
nobody is poor unless he stand in need of justice
the hungry judges soon the sentence sign and wretches hang that jurymen may dine
there is no such thing as justice  in or out of court
justice is too good for some people and not good enough for the rest
injustice never rules forever
acquittal of the guilty damns the judge
there is no virtue so truly great and godlike as justice
the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day
there is no such thing as justice  in or out of court
delay of justice is injustice
the spirits of just men made perfect
gods mill grinds slow but sure
the sword of the law should never fall but on those whose guilt is so apparent as to be pronounced by their friends as well as foes
render therefore to all their dues
he who decides a case without hearing the other side though he decide justly cannot be considered just
this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh
thrice is he armd that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lockd up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
let justice be done though the heavens fall
have you had a kindness shown
pass it on twas not given for thee alone pass it on let it travel down the years let it wipe anothers tears til in heaven the deed appears    pass it on
their cause i plead  plead it in heart and mind a fellowfeeling makes one wondrous kind
at little more than kin and less than kind
yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o the milk of human kindness
kindness gives birth to kindness
some women blush when they are kissed some call for the police some swear some bite
but the worst are those who laugh
gin a body meets a body comin through the rye
gin a body kiss a body need a body cry
come lay thy head upon my breast and i will kiss thee into rest
it was thy kiss love that made me immortal
give me a kisse and to that kisse a score then to that twenty adde a hundred more a thousand to that hundred so kisse on to make that thousand up a million treble that million and when that is done lets kisse afresh as when we first begun
a long long kiss a kiss of youth and love
stolen kisses are always sweetest
jenny kissed me when we met jumping from the chair she sat in time you thief who love to get sweets into your list put that in
say im weary say im sad say that health and wealth have missed me say im growing old but add jenny kissed me
see
the mountains kiss high heaven and the waves clasp one another no sister flower would be forgiven if it disdained its brother and the sunlight clasps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea   what are all these kissings worth if thou kiss not me
lord
i wonder what fool it was that first invented kissing
drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss but in the cup and ill not look for wine
soul meets soul on lovers lips
all men by nature desire to know
i am not young enough to know everything
i have tried to know absolutely nothing about a great many things and i have succeeded fairly well
little minds are interested in the extraordinary great minds in the commonplace
our knowledge can only be finite while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite
pocket all your knowledge with your watch and never pull it out in company unless desired
president reagan didnt always know what he knew
ten lands are sooner known than one man
the public do not know enough to be experts yet know enough to decide between them

there was never an age in which useless knowledge was more important than in our own
were drowning in information and starving for knowledge
you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough
zeal without knowledge is fire without light
our knowledge is a receding mirage in an expanding desert of ignorance
knowledge is of two kinds we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it
as we acquire more knowledge things do not become more comprehensible but more mysterious
a man must carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge
grace is given of god but knowledge is bought in the market
if a little knowledge is dangerous  where is the man who has so much as to be out of danger
we owe almost all our knowledge not to those who have agreed but to those who have differed
sit down before fact as a little child be prepared to give up every preconceived notion follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss nature leads or you shall learn nothing
the learned is happy nature to explore the fool is happy that he knows no more
one of the greatest joys known to man is to take a flight into ignorance in search of knowledge
i do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure of
a man only understands what is akin to something already existing in himself
everybody gets so much common information all day long that they lose their common sense
anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty
anyone who keeps learning stays young
the greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young
the first problem for all of us men and women is not to learn but to unlearn
we should live and learn but by the time weve learned its too late to live
the specialist is a man who fears the other subjects
all that men really understand is confined to a very small compass to their daily affairs and experience to what they have an opportunity to know and motives to study or practise
the rest is affectation and imposture
there is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge
every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority
it isnt what we dont know that gives us trouble its what we know that aint so
in all affairs love religion politics or business its a healthy idea now and then to hang a question mark on things you have long taken for granted
knowledge is power
man is not weak  knowledge is more than equivalent to force
the master of mechanics laughs at strength
to know that we know what we know and that we do not know what we do not know that is true knowledge
the simplest questions are the hardest to answer
they know enough who know how to learn
strange how much youve got to know before you know how little you know
i take all knowledge to be my province
to be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge
for knowledge too is itself a power
the only good is knowledge and the only evil ignorance
he that increaseth knowledge increascth sorrow
our knowledge is the amassed thought and experience of innumerable minds
one cannot know everything
knowledge is of two kinds
we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it
he who knows others is learned he who knows himself is wise
it aint the things you dont know what gets you into trouble its the things you know for sure what aint so
better know nothing than halfknow many things
he that hath knowledge spareth his words
then i began to think that it is very true which is commonly said that the onehalf of the world knoweth not how the other half liveth
we know what we are but know not what we may be
and seeing ignorance is the curse of god knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven
know thyself
as for me all i know is that i know nothing
they can expect nothing but their labor for their pains
for as labor cannot produce without the use of land the denial of the equal right to use of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to its own produce
a truly american sentiment recognises the dignity of labor and the fact that honor lies in honest toil
shall you complain who feed the world
who clothe the world
who house the world
shall you complain who are the world of what the world may do
as from this hour you use your power the world must follow you
labor conquers all things
god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb
mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow and everywhere that mary went the lamb was sure to go
like lambs to the slaughter

the small landholders are the most precious part of a state
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
that which is built upon the land goes with the land
babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth
but for my own part it was greek to me
i am the king of rome and above grammar
language as well as the faculty of speech was the immediate gift of god
the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
no man fully capable of his own language ever masters another
language is not an abstract construction of the learned or of dictionarymakers but is something arising out of the work needs ties joys affections tastes of long generations of humanity and has its bases broad and low close to the ground
rise with the lark and with the lark to bed
hail to thee blithe spirit
bird thou never wert that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art
he laughs best who laughs last
to provoke laughter without joining in it greatly heightens the effect
i hasten to laugh at everything for fear of being obliged to weep
the man who cannot laugh is not only fit for treasons strategems and spoils but his whole life is already a treason and a stratagem
as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of a fool
man is the only creature endowed with the power of laughter
man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter
laugh and the world laughs with you weep and you weep alone for the sad old earth must borrow its mirth but has trouble enough of its own
nothing is more silly than silly laughter
appeal in law to put the dice into the box for another throw
divorce is a game played by lawyers

law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life
its history is the history of the moral development of the race
laws are the spiders webs which if anything small falls into them they ensnare it but large things break through and escape
lawyers are the only persons in whom ignorance of the law is not punished
lawyers spend a great deal of time shovelling smoke
revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more mans nature runs to the more ought law to weed it out
that is the beauty of the common law it is a maze and not a motorway
the law of england is a very strange one it cannot compel anyone to tell the truth



but what the law can do is to give you seven years for not telling the truth
trudeau yes well there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just dont like to see people with helmets and guns
all i can say is go on and bleed but it is more important to keep law and order in a society than to be worried about weakkneed people who we dont like the looks of
reporter at any cost
how far would you go with that
how far would you extend that
trudeau well just watch me



when the 30yearold lawyer died he said to st peter how can you do this to me

my clients lose even when they win
law and order is one of the steps taken to maintain injustice
whatever is enforced by command is more imputed to him who exacts than to him who performs
the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience
every new time will give its law
lawyers and painters can soon change white to black
no man is above the law and no man is below it nor do we ask any mans permission when we ask him to obey it
fragile as reason is and limited as law is as the institutionalized medium of reason thats all we have standing between us and the tyranny of mere will and the cruelty of unbridled undisciplined feeling
a lawyers dream of heaven  every man reclaimed his property at the resurrection and each tried to recover it from all his forefathers
a vague uneasiness the police
its like when you suddenly understand you have to undress in front of the doctor
a successful lawsuit is the one worn by a policeman
those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws
others sense their own laws within them
every skilled person is to be believed with reference to his own art
an excess of law inescapably weakens the rule of law
a judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers
i understand you undertake to overthrow my undertaking
the law locks up both man and woman who steals the goose from off the common but lets the great felon loose who steals the common from the goose
i know of no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution

to some lawyers all facts are created equal
and whether youre an honest man or whether youre a thief depends on whose solicitor has given me my brief

in crossexamination as in fishing nothing is more ungainly than a fisherman pulled into the water by his catch

i have been so great a lover filled my days so proudly with the splendour of loves praise the pain the calm and the astonishment desire illimitable and silent content and all dear names men use to cheat despair for the perplexed and viewless streams that bear our hearts at random down the dark of life
the one thing we can never get enough of is love
and the one thing we never give enough of is love
there can be no peace of mind in love since the advantage one has secured is never anything by a fresh startingpoint for further desires
what i cannot love i overlook
a loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself  to laugh with me but never at me to cry with me but never because of me to love life to love himself to love being loved
such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart
love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination
love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence
we are all born for love it is the principle of existence and its only end
love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the end so easy
among those whom i like or admire i can find no common denominator but among those whom i love i can all of them make me laugh
life isnt long enough for love and art
the essence of love is kindness
love


includes fellowship in suffering in joy and in effort
when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace
love is anterior to life posterior to death initial of creation and the exponent of breath
who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars
love is ever the beginning of knowledge as fire is of light
life in common among people who love each other is the ideal of happiness
i wonder what memories of yours will persist as you go on in life
my hunch is that the most important will have to do with feelings of loving and being loved  whoevers been close to you
as you continue to grow youll find many ways of expressing your love and youll discover more and more ways in which others express their love for you
where love is no room is too small
if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die
that strain again
it had a dying fall o it came oer my ear like the sweet sound
they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world someone to love something to do and something to hope for
it is love not reason that is stronger than death
love feels no burden regards not labors strives toward more than it attains argues not of impossibility since it believes that it may and can do all things
therefore it avails for all things and fulfils and accomplishes much where one not a lover falls and lies helpless
love your neighbor as yourself but dont take down the fence
there is no better exercise for strengthening the heart than reaching down and lifting up another
love does not dominate it cultivates
life is pain and the enjoyment of love is an anesthetic
love is letting go of fear
if we all discovered that we only had five minutes left to say all that we wanted to say every telephone booth would be occupied by people calling other people to tell them that they loved them
love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
age does not protect you from love
but love to some extent protects you from age
and remember my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
loves like the measles  all the worse when it comes late in life
ofttimes the test of courage becomes rather to live than to die
every mans life is a fairytale written by gods fingers
life is a jig saw puzzle with most of the pieces missing
i expect to pass through this world but once
any good therefore that i can do or any kindness that i can show to any fellow creature let me do it now
let me not defer or neglect it for i shall not pass this way again
we come and we cry and that is life we yawn and we depart and that is death
it matters not how long we live but how
life is a long lesson in humility
it is a misery to be born a pain to live a trouble to die
life is but a day at most
one life  a little gleam of time between two eternities
hurried and worried until were buried and theres no curtain call lifes a very funny proposition after all
for life in general there is but one decree youth is a blunder manhood a struggle old age a regret
out of sleeping a waking out of waking a sleep
our whole life is like a play
no one is to be despaired of as long as he breathes
while there is life there is hope
dost thou love life
then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of
a useless life is an early death
all that a man hath will he give for his life
life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who think
every life is many days day after day
we walk through ourselves meeting robbers ghosts giants old men young men wives widows brothersinlove
but always meeting ourselves
tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream
christian life consists in faith and charity
strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life
my candle burns at both ends it will not last the night but ah my foes and oh my friends   it gives a lovely light
ah love
could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would we not shatter it to bits  and then remould it nearer to the hearts desire
life is the game that must be played this truth at least good friends we know so live and laugh nor be dismayed as one by one the phantoms go
i wish to preach not the doctrine of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life
as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what matters
his saying was live and let live
out out brief candle
lifes but a walking shadow
may you live all the days of your life
let your life lightly dance on the edges of time like dew on the tip of a leaf
the white flower of a blameless life
life is a game of whist
from unseen sources the cards are shuffled and the hands are dealt
i do not like the way the cards are shuffled but yet i like the game and want to play
men know life too early women know life too late
all the things i really like to do are either immoral illegal or fattening
and god said let there be light and there was light
the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
he was a burning and a shining light
lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom lead thou me on
the night is dark and i am far from home   lead thou me on
keep thou my feet i do not ask to see the distant scene  one step enough for me
and this i know whether the one true light kindle to love or wrath consume me quite one flash of it within the tavern caught better than in the temple lost outright
nature and natures laws lay hid in night god said let newton be
and all was light
a light heart lives long
the one important thing i have learned over the years is the difference between taking ones work seriously and taking ones self seriously
the first is imperative and the second is disastrous
man unlike the animal has never learned that the sole purpose of life is to enjoy it
there is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval
lifes better when its fun
boy thats deep isnt it
when a man is gloomy everything seems to go wrong when he is cheerful everything seems right
an ounce of cheerfulness is worth a pound of sadness to serve god with
years back someone said cod liver oil was the cureall
cheerfulness is more palliative and with no unpleasant aftertaste
cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind filling it with a steady and perpetual serenity
the highest wisdom is continual cheerfulness such a state like the region above the moon is always clear and serene
let us be of good cheer remembering that misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never come
burdens become light when cheerfully borne
a happy woman is one who has no cares at all a cheerful woman is one who has cares but doesnt let them get her down
even if we cant be happy we must always be cheerful
nature intended you to be the fountainspring of cheerfulness and social life and not the mountain of despair and melancholy
you find yourself refreshed by the presence of cheerful people
why not make an earnest effort to confer that pleasure on others
half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy
cheerfulness is contagious but dont wait to catch it from others
be a carrier
if god came in and said i want you to be happy for the rest of your life what would you do
true happiness is to understand our duties toward god and man to enjoy the present without anxious dependence on the future not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have which is abundantly sufficient
many people think that if they were only in some other place or had some other job they would be happy
well that is doubtful
so get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and dont put off being happy until some future date
youre happiest while youre making the greatest contribution
the happiest and most contented people are those who each day perform to make the best of their abilities
none but those who are happy in themselves can make others so
do you want a world with


more joy and happiness
then find your own joy and happiness and contribute to the joy and happiness of others
one thing i know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve
happiness is a perfume which you cannot pour on someone without getting some on yourself
remember that happiness is as contagious as gloom
it should be the first duty of those who are happy to let others know of their gladness
those who are happiest are those who do the most for others
make people happy and there will not be half the quarreling or a tenth part of the wickedness there now is
lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly to everyone about you and you will be surprised what a happy life you will lead
if you want to be happy set yourself a goal that commands your thoughts liberates your energy and inspires your hopes
happiness is within you
it comes from doing some certain thing into which you can put all your thought and energy
if you want to be happy get enthusiastic about something
happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort
the way to happiness keep your heart free from hate your mind from worry
live simply expect little give much
fill your life with love
scatter sunshine
forget self think of others
do as you would be done by
try this for a week and you will be surprised
the happiness of life is made up of minute fractions  the little soonforgotten charities of a kiss or smile a kind look a heartfelt compliment and the countless infinitesimals of pleasurable and genial feeling
a happy life is made up of little things


a gift sent a letter written a call made a recommendation given transportation provided a cake made a book lent a check sent
do not worry eat three square meals a day say your prayers be courteous to your creditors keep your digestion good exercise go slow and easy
maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy but my friend these i reckon will give you a good life
the secret of happiness is this let your interests be as wide as possible and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile
the secret of happiness is not in doing what one likes but in liking what one does
the secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles
the secret of happiness is to count your blessings  not your birthdays
to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness
it is not how much we have but how much we enjoy that makes happiness
before strongly desiring anything we should look carefully into the happiness of its present owner
we have all been placed on this earth to discover our own path and we will never be happy if we live someone elses idea of life
the grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do something to love and something to hope for
but what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads
we all have 100 to deal with in our lives 10 is important 90 unimportant
the secret to a happy productive life is to deal with the 10 and let the 90 slip
with a little discipline and regular selfchecks you can learn to do one thing at a time
and do it better
and be happier doing it
ive been riding the carousel in central park since i was five years old


if im very depressed or if somethings bothering me today my husband larry and i go back to the park
we get on the carousel horse and we start riding and i start singing at the top of my lungs
it is pure and absolute joy and happiness
its never too late to have a happy childhood
life holds so much so much to be happy about always
most people ask for happiness on condition
happiness can be felt only if you dont set any conditions
happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love grace and gratitude
better to be happy than wise
happiness is a butterfly which when pursued is always just beyond your grasp but which if you will sit down quietly may alight upon you
your success and happiness lie in you
resolve to keep happy and your joy and you shall form an invisible host against difficulties
remember that happiness is a way of travel not a destination
when ill luck besets us to ease the tension we have only to remember that happiness is relative
the next time you are tempted to grumble about what has happened to you why not pause and be glad that it is no worse than it is
when one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us
i have found that most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be
it is the happiness that comes from within that is lasting and fulfilling
each person on this planet is inherently intrinsically capable of attaining dizzying heights of happiness and fulfillment
the ingredients of happiness are so simple that they can be counted on one hand
happiness comes from within and rests most securely on simple goodness and clear conscience
we are never so happy nor so unhappy as we imagine
you have to believe in happiness or happiness never comes
it is a mans proper business to seek happiness and avoid misery
the best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today
why should we refuse the happiness this hour gives us because some other hour might take it away
at the end of our time on earth if we have lived fully we will not be able to say i was always happy
hopefully we will be able to say i have experienced a lifetime of real moments and many of them were happy moments
cherish all your happy moments they make a fine cushion for old age
happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence
the time to be happy is now
the place to be happy is here
happiness and love are just a choice away
our happiness depends on the habit of mind we cultivate
so practice happy thinking every day
cultivate the merry heart develop the happiness habit and life will become a continual feast
humor is the healthy way of feeling distance between ones self and the problem a way of standing off and looking at ones problems with perspective
humor has great power to heal on an emotional level
you cant hold anger you cant hold fear you cant hold hurt while youre laughing
humor enables one to live in the midst of tragic events without becoming a tragic figure
there is no defense against adverse fortune which is so effectual as an habitual sense of humor
humor is our way of defending ourselves from lifes absurdities by thinking absurdly about them
common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing moving at different speeds
a sense of humor is just common sense dancing
there is always something to chuckle about
sometimes we see it
sometimes


we dont
still the world is filled with humor
it is there when we are happy and it is there to cheer us up when we are not
joy is the most infallible sign of the presence of god
listen to the clues
the next time you feel real joy stop and think
pay attention
because joy is the universes way of knocking on your minds door
hello in there
is anyone home
can i leave a message
yes
good i the message is that you are happy and that means that you are in touch with your purpose
joy of life seems to me to arise from a sense of being where one belongs  of being foursquare with the life we have chosen
all the discontented people i know are trying sedulously to be something they are not to do something they cannot do
when we align our thoughts emotions and actions with the highest part of ourselves we are filled with enthusiasm purpose and meaning



we are joyously and intimately engaged with our world
this is the experience of authentic power
we have a tendency to obscure the forest of simple joys with the trees of problems
people need joy quite as much as clothing
some of them need it far more
when large numbers of people share their joy in common the happiness of each is greater because each adds fuel to the others flame
joys divided are increased
you increase your joy by increasing the pure joy of others
joy increases as you give it and diminishes as you try to keep it for yourself
in giving it you will accumulate a deposit of joy greater than you ever believed possible
as you express joy you draw it out of those you meet creating joyful people and joyful events
the greater the joy you express the more joy you experience
when we feel joyful euphoric happy we are more open to life more capable of seeing things clearly and handling daily tensions
if we could learn how to balance rest against effort calmness against strain quiet against turmoil we would assure ourselves of joy in living and psychological health for life
simplicity clarity singleness these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy
joy is not in things it is in us
joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside
joy is the will which labors which overcomes obstacles which knows triumph
it is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory and in creative action that man finds his supreme joy
i believe humans were born to have joy and to have it more abundantly that the birthright of everyone is loving caring sharing and abundance
joy is your birthright
blessed are the joymakers
although a lot can be learned from adversity most of the same lessons can be learned through laughter and joy
so when youre lonely or sad or bad or blue remember where laughters hiding


its hiding inside of you
against the assault of laughter nothing can stand
in every job relationship or life situation there is inevitably some turbulence
learn to laugh at it
it is part of what you do and who you are
laughter puts your brain your central nervous system and your whole being into a state of free play
laughing deeply is living deeply
it has always seemed to me that hearty laughter is a good way to jog internally without having to go outdoors
a good belly laugh is like taking your liver for a horseback ride
he laughs best whose laugh lasts
shared laughter is like throwing open the shutters in a gloomy room and letting in fresh air and sunshine
laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human race
shared laughter is love made audible
a good laugh helps us recognize how ridiculous it is to get excited about matters that are often trivial



laughter is the brush that sweeps away the cobwebs of the heart
when we can laugh through our tears we are being given a powerful message
things may be bad but they cannot be all that bad
the child in you like all children loves to laugh to be around people who can laugh at themselves and life
children instinctively know that the more laughter we have in our lives the better
laughter is a gift everyone should open
in the true man there is a child concealed  who wants to play
play keeps us vital and alive
it gives us an enthusiasm for life that is irreplaceable
without it life just doesnt taste good
its good to play and you must keep in practice
the supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play
a little work a little play to keep us going  and so goodday
every time a man smiles and much more when he laughs it adds something to his fragment of life
what sunshine is to flowers smiles are to humanity
they are but trifles to be sure but scattered along lifes pathway the good they do is inconceivable
its easy enough to be pleasant when everything goes like a song but the man who is worthwhile is the man who can smile when everything goes dead wrong
if you have made another person on this earth smile your life has been worthwhile
wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been
of all the things you wear your expression is the most important
it is only through love that we can attain to communion with god
all living knowledge of god rest upon this foundation that we experience him in our lives as willtolove
one word frees us of all the weight and pain of life that word is love
it makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble how hopeless the outlook how muddled the tangle how great the mistake
a sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all
if only you could love enough you would be the happiest and most powerful being in the world
love is the master key which opens the gates of happiness
there is only one happiness in life to love and be loved
let no one who loves be called unhappy
even love unreturned has its rainbow
what a grand thing to be loved
what a grander thing still to lovel
to love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides
love


binds everything together in perfect harmony
for love  is the blood of life the power of reunion in the separated
it is this intangible thing love in many forms which enters into every therapeutic relationship



and it is an element which binds and heals which comforts and restores which works what we have to call  for now  miracles
this is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love the more they give the more they possess
the one thing we can never get enough of is love
and the one thing we never give enough of is love
love sought is good but given unsought is better
dont shut love out of your life by saying its impossible to find time
the quickest way to receive love is to give the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly and the best way to keep love is to give it wings
the love we give away is the only one we keep
if you would be loved love and be lovable
the issue is not so much being loved but being loving which leads to the same wonderful feeling you experience when someone loves you
everybody forgets the basic thing people are not going to love you unless you love them
a loving person lives in a loving world
a hostile person lives in a hostile world everyone you meet is your mirror
nine times out of ten when you extend your arms to someone they will step in because basically they need precisely what you need
love your enemies because they bring out the best in you
tolerance and celebration of individual differences is the fire that fuels lasting love
do not waste time bothering whether you love your neighbor act as if you did
as soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets
when you are behaving as if you loved someone you will presently come to love him
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
love is a force that connects us to every strand of the universe an unconditional state that characterizes human nature a form of knowledge that is always there for us if only we can open ourselves to it
when we connect with ourselves in love we can connect with others and the planet in love
choose to be a lovefinder rather than a faultfinder
if you judge people you have no time to love them
someday after we have mastered the winds the waves the tide and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love
then for the second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire
love keeps the cold out better than a cloak
in the coldest february as in every other month in every other year the best thing to hold on to in this world is each other
true love always brings joy to ourself and to the one we love
if our love does not bring joy to both of us it is not true love
true love comes quietly without banners or flashing lights
if you hear bells get your ears checked
true love is night jasmine a diamond in darkness the heartbeat no cardiologist has ever heard
it is the most common of miracles fashioned of fleecy clouds  a handful of stars tossed into the night sky
the essence of love is kindness
love is what we were born with
fear is what we learned here
love is letting go of fear
love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident a tight girdle a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over philadelphia
the eskimos had fiftytwo names for snow because it was important to them there ought to be as many for love
every single one of us can do things that no one else can do can love things that no one else can love


we are like violins
we can be used for doorstops or we can make music
but some emotions dont make a lot of noise
its hard to hear pride
caring is real faint  like a heartbeat
and pure love why some days its so quiet you dont even know its there
love is not what we become but who we already are
ultimately love is selfapproval
love is above all the gift of oneself
you must love yourself before you love another
by accepting yourself and fully being what you are


your simple presence can make others happy
it is not what we do it is how much love we put in the doing
forget the resolutions
forget control and discipline


too much work
instead try experimenting
go in search of something to fall in love with


something about yourself your career your spouse
find something you love to do and youll never have to work a day in your life
you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you really lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love
we are most alive when were in love
in our life there is a single color as on an artists palette which provides the meaning of life and art
it is the color of love
life is a flower of which love is the honey
no one who has ever brought up a child can doubt for a moment that love is literally the lifegiving fluid of human existence
anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough
not only have i found that when i talk to the little flower or to the little peanut they will give up their secrets but i have found that when i silently commune with people they give up their secrets also  if you love them enough
a fiveword sentence that could change the world tomorrow is what would love do now
do not seek perfection in a changing world
instead perfect your love
every day we are offered new means for learning and growing in love
spend a moment every day thinking of someone to love
ultimately love is everything
what the world really needs is more love and less paperwork
love doesnt make the world go round
love is what makes the ride worthwhile
love is how you stay alive even after you are gone
birds of a feather flock together
like mother like daughter
one crow will not pick out another crows eyes
like will to like each creature loves his kind
like father like son
i shall not look upon his like again
his heart was as great as the world but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong
honesty rare as a man without selfpity kindness as large and plain as a prairie wind

a novel is a mirror carried along a main road
a novel is never anything but a philosophy put into images
biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man  the biography of the man himself cannot be written

london is a roost for every bird

any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankinde and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
who knows what true loneliness is  not the conventional word but the naked terror
to the lonely themselves it wears a mask

luck is everything
my good luck in life was to be a really frightened person
im fortunate to be a coward to have a low threshold of fear because a hero couldnt make a good suspense film
most of life is choices and the rest is pure dumb luck
exceptional talent does not always win its reward unless favoured by exceptional circumstances
i would rather have a lucky general than a smart general

they win battles and they make me lucky
there is a spirit and a need and a man at the beginning of every great human advance
every one of these must be right for that particular moment of history or nothing happens
everything in life is luck
tis mans to fight but heavens to give success
i am persuaded that luck and timing have in my case been very important
i have been extraordinarily lucky
anyone who pretends that some kind of luck isnt involved in his success is deluding himself
tis better to be fortunate than wise
i wish i could tell you that the childrens television workshop and sesame street were thanks to my genius but it really was a lucky break
in the queer mess of human destiny the determining factor is luck
much of my good fortune was a matter of nothing more clever on my part than luck
name the greatest of all inventors accident
though men pride themselves on their great actions often they are not the result of any great design but of chance
no writer should minimize the factor that affects everyone but is beyond control luck
everything that happened to me happened by mistake
i dont believe in fate
its luck timing and accident
luck always seems to be against the man who depends on it
the doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live
good luck is often with the man who doesnt include it in his plans

luck enters into every contingency
you are a fool if you forget itand a greater fool if you count upon it
they who await no gifts from chance have conquered fate
the worst cynicism a belief in luck
to believe in luck  is skepticism
shallow men believe in luck wise and strong men in cause and effect
those who trust to chance must abide by the results of chance
luck is what a capricious man believes in
luck serves  as rationalization for every people that is not master of its own destiny
it is a madness to make fortune the mistress of events because in herself she is nothing but is ruled by prudence
luck is a word devoid of sense nothing can exist without a cause
woe to him who would ascribe something like reason to chance and make a religion of surrendering to it
fortune is the rod of the weak and the staff of the brave
the man who is intent on making the most of his opportunities is too busy to bother about luck
luck implies an absolute absence of any principle

i think it sucks

the champion makes his own luck
it is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck even while waiting for it
i was thinking of my patients and how the worst moment for them was when they discovered they were masters of bad or good luck
when they could no longer blame fate they were in despair
some are satisfied to stand politely before the portals of fortune and to await her bidding better those who push forward who employ their enterprise who on the wings of their worth and valor seek to embrace luck and to effectively gain her favor
chance never helps those who do not help themselves
failure and success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars
but they retain the power of wriggling of fighting with their star or against it and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle
go and wake up your luck
people make their own luck
when it comes time to do your own life you either perpetuate your childhood or you stand on it and finally kick it out from under
if fate means you to lose give him a good fight anyhow
i was forced to live far beyond my years when just a child now i have reversed the order and i intend to remain young indefinitely
we create our fate every day  most of the ills we suffer from are directly traceable to our own behavior
of course fortune has its part in human affairs but conduct is really much more important
you dont just luck into things you build step by step whether its friendships or opportunities
i got well by talking
death could not get a word in edgewise grew discouraged and traveled on

you can go as fast or as slow as you want to go  and you can change the road youre on at any time
we must master our good fortune or it will master us
im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
good luck needs no explanation
luck means the hardships and privations which you have not hesitated to endure the long nights you have devoted to work
luck means the appointments you have never failed to keep the trains you have never failed to catch
luck is what you have left over after you give ioo percent
luck is not chance its toil fortunes expensive smile is earned
the lucky fellow is the plucky fellow who has been burning midnight oil and taking defeat after defeat with a smile
there is no such thing as making the miracle happen spontaneously and on the spot
youve got to work
i dont know anything about luck
ive never banked on it and im afraid of people who do
luck to me is something else hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what isnt
men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose
as a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck
i dont believe in luck
we make our own good fortune
you have to learn the rules of the game
and then you have to play better than anyone else
luck is the byproduct of busting your fanny
when you work seven days a week fourteen hours a day you get lucky
the more you invest in a marriage the more valuable it becomes
love doesnt just sit there like a stone it has to be made like bread remade all the time made new
no man ever wetted clay and then left it as if there would be bricks by chance and fortune
some people go through life trying to find out what the world holds for them only to find out too late that its what they bring to the world that really counts
pennies do not come from heaven they have to be earned here on earth
its hard to detect good luckit looks so much like something youve earned
chance favors those in motion
work and acquire and thou hast chained the wheel of chance
superiority to fate is difficult to gain tis not conferred of any but possible to earn
some folk want their luck buttered
diligence is the mother of good luck and god gives all things to industry
fortune is ever seen accompanying industry
i find im luckier when i work harder
good luck is a lazy mans estimate of a workers success
throw a lucky man into the sea and he will come up with a fish in his mouth
as illluck would have it
a pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck
behind bad luck comes good luck
hush my dear lie still and slumber holy angels guard thy bed
heavenly blessings without number gently falling on thy head
rockabye baby on the tree top when the wind blows the cradle will rock when the bough breaks the cradle will fall down will come baby cradle and all
sweet and low sweet and low wind of the western sea low low breathe and blow wind of the western sea
over the rolling waters go come from the dying moon and blow blow him again to me while my little one while my pretty one sleeps
peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost
and after all what is a lie
tis but the truth in masquerade
a liar is not believed even though he tell the truth
any fool can tell the truth but it requires a man of some sense to know how to lie well
terminological inexactitude
a good memory is needed once we have lied
show me a liar and i will show thee a thief
who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gates of hell
the liars punishment is not in the least that he is not believed but that he cannot believe anyone else
that a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies that a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright   but a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight
a tool is but the extension of a mans hand and a machine is but a complex tool
he that invents a machine augments the power of a man and the well being of mankind
man is a toolusing animal
one machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men
no machine can do the work of one extraordinary man
men have become the tools of their tools

they merely reduce our responsiveness to stimuli
they dull the keen edge of the angers fears or anxiety with which we might otherwise react to the problems of living
once the response has been dulled the irritating surface noise of living muted or eliminated the spark and brilliance are also gone

goodnight
goodnight
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say goodnight til it be morrow
mans feelings are always purest and most glowing in the hour of meeting and of farewell
visits always give pleasure  if not the arrival the departure
theres a kind of release and a kind of torment in every goodbye for every man
parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell
the joys of meeting pay the pangs of absence else who could bear it

now the frosty stars are gone i have watched them one by one fading on the shores of dawn
round and full the glorious sun walks with level step the spray through his vestibule of day
the greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
lose an hour in the morning and you will be all day hunting for it
there never was night that had no morn
weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
sadness flies on the wings of the morning and out of the heart of darkness comes the light
out of the scabbard of the night by gods hand drawn flashes his shining sword of light and lo the dawn
for what human ill does not dawn seem to be an alleviation
the weariest night the longest day sooner or later must perforce come to an end
beware of desprate steps the darkest day lived till tomorrow will have passd away
have hope
though clouds environs now and gladness hides her face in scorn put thou the shadow from thy brow no night but hath its morn
snow endures but for a season and joy comes with the morning
the morning is wiser than the evening
for the mind disturbed the still beauty of dawn is natures finest balm
hold your head high stick your chest out
you can make it
it gets dark sometimes but morning comes
keep hope alive
each day the world is born anew for him who takes it rightly
it is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it
each day is a new life
seize it
live it
we sail at sunrise daily outward bound
always begin anew with the day just as nature does
it is one of the sensible things that nature does
with each sunrise we start anew
i have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day a fresh try one more start with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning
relying on god has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done
have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself
do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew
each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death
i love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much i can accomplish
whether one is twenty forty or sixty whether one has succeeded failed or just muddled along whether yesterday was full of sun or storm or one of those dull days with no weather at all life begins each morning
each morning is the open door to a new worldnew vistas new aims new tryings
to be seeing the world made new every morning as if it were the morning of the first day and then to make the most of it for the individual soul as if each were the last day is the daily curriculum of the minds desire
do not say it is morning and dismiss it with a name of yesterday
see it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name
god had infinite time to give us
he cut it up into a near succession of new mornings and with each therefore a new idea new inventions and new applications
we are new every day
no matter how big or soft or warm your bed is you still have to get out of it
spill not the morning the quintessence of the day
in recreations for sleep is a recreation
add not therefore sauce to sauce

pastime like wine is poison in the morning
it is then good husbandry to sow the head which hath lain fallow all night with some serious work
do not shorten the morning by getting up late look upon it as the quintessence of life and to a certain extent sacred
let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate
hed jolt up in bed every morning sit quietly for a moment and you could feel those wheels spinning in his mind as he planned his day
then hed hit the floor almost on the run
clay lies still but bloods a rover breaths a ware that will not keep
up lad when the journeys over therell be time enough to sleep
even if a farmer intends to loaf he gets up in time to get an early start
wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving
i thank you god for this most amazing day for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes
i get up and i bless the light thin clouds and the first twittering of birds and the breathing air and smiling face of the hills
im a most lucky and thankful woman
lucky and thankful for each morning i wake up
for three wonderful daughters and one son
for an understanding and very loving husband with whom ive shared fiftytwo blessed years all in good health
if god adds another day to our life let us receive it gladly
here we stand between two eternities of darkness
what are we to do with this glory while it is still ours
your morning thoughts may determine your conduct for the day
optimistic thoughts will make your day bright and productive while pessimistic thinking will make it dull and wasteful
face each day cheerfully smilingly and courageously and it will naturally follow that your work will be a real pleasure and progress will be a delightful accomplishment
you should always know when youre shifting gears in life
you should leave your era it should never leave you
the first thing each morning and the last thing each night suggest to yourself specific ideas that you wish to embody in your character and personality
address such suggestions to yourself silently or aloud until they are deeply impressed upon your mind
everyday ask yourself the question do i want to experience peace of mind or do i want to experience conflict
it was only a sunny smile and little it cost in the giving
but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living
to get up each morning with the resolve to be happy  is to set our own conditions to the events of each day
to do this is to condition circumstances instead of being conditioned by them
today is a new day
you will get out of it just what you put into it

if you have made mistakes even serious mistakes there is always another chance for you
and supposing you have tried and failed again and again you may have a fresh start any moment you choose for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down
when you rise in the morning form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature
as soon as you open your eyes in the morning you can square away for a happy and successful day
its the mood and the purpose at the inception of each day that are the important facts in charting your course for the day
we can always square away for a fresh start no matter what the past has been
this is the beginning of a new day
god has given me this day to use as i will
i can waste it or use it for good but what i do today is important because i am exchanging a day of my life for it
when tomorrow comes this day will be gone forever leaving in its place something that i have traded for it
i want it to be gain and not loss good and not evil success and not failure in order that i shall not regret the price i have paid for it
i think in terms of the days resolutions not the years
every new day begins with possibilities
its up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace
here hath been dawning another blue day think wilt thou let it slip useless away
be pleasant until ten oclock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself
today a thousand doors of enterprise are open to you inviting you to useful work
to live at this time is an inestimable privilege and a sacred obligation devolves upon you to make right use of your opportunities
today is the day in which to attempt and achieve something worthwhile
get out of bed forcing a smile
you may not smile because you are cheerful but if you will force yourself to smile youll be cheerful because you smile
repeated experiments prove that when man assumes the facial expression of a given mental mood any given mood then that mental mood itself will follow
he who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows that plan carries thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life
a man without a plan for the day is lost before he starts
never be afraid to sit awhile and think
only the thinking man lives his life the thoughtless mans life passes him by
my credo is etched on my mirror in my bathroom and i see it when i brush my teeth in the morning
it says dont worry be happy feel good
when you see that first thing and you reflect on it the rest of the day seems to glide by pretty well
only that day dawns to which we are awake
the day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating concerns and duties
help us to play the man help us to perform them with laughter and kind faces let cheerfulness abound with industry
give us to go blithely on our business all this day bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonored and grant us in the end the gift of sleep
a day dawns quite like other days in it a single hour comes quite like other hours but in that day and in that hour the chance of a lifetime faces us
one never knows what each day is going to bring
the important thing is to be open and ready for it
great opportunities come to all but many do not know they have met them
the only preparation to take advantage of them is  to watch what each day brings
there will be something anguish or elation that is peculiar to this day alone
i rise from sleep and say hail to the morning
come down to me my beautiful unknown
the sun is new each day
someday the sun is going to shine down on me in some faraway place
with every rising of the sun think of your life as just begun
i feel very happy to see the sun come up every day
i feel happy to be around

i like to take this day any dayand go to town with it
look to the east where up the lucid sky the morning climbs
the day shall yet be fair
each golden sunrise ushers in new opportunities for those who retain faith in themselves and keep their chins up meet the sunrise with confidence
fill every golden minute with right thinking and worthwhile endeavor
do this and there will be joy for you in each golden sunset
today a new sun rises for me everything lives everything is animated everything seems to speak to me of my passion everything invites me to cherish it
what humbugs we are who pretend to live for beauty and never see the dawn
sunrise days great progenitor
put yourself in competition with yourself each day
each morning look back upon your work of yesterday and then try to beat it
the morning has gold in its mouth
do you know what the greatest test is
do you still get excited about what you do when you get up in the morning
oft when the white still dawn lifted the skies and pushed the hills apart i have felt it like a glory in my heart
sometimes i have believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
the mind is found most acute and most uneasy in the morning
uneasiness is indeed a species of sagacitya passive sagacity
fools are never uneasy
days sweetest moments are at dawn
all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust
oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a fastflitting meteor a fastflying cloud a flash of the lightning a break of the wave he passes from life to his rest in the grave
the mother of all living
shes somebodys mother boys you know for all shes aged and poor and slow
a mother is a mother still the holiest thing alive
men are what their mothers made them
what is home without a mother
there is none in all this cold and hollow world no fount of deep strong deathless love save that within a mothers heart
if i were hanged on the highest hill mother o mine o mother o mine
i know whose love would follow me still mother o mine o mother o mine
all that i am or hope to be i owe to my angel mother
i arose a mother in israel
the bravest battle that ever was fought shall i tell you where and when
on the maps of the world you will find it not it was fought by the mothers of men
who ran to help me when i fell and would some pretty story tell or kiss the place to make it well
my mother
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
sure i love the dear silver that shines in your hair and the brow thats all furrowed and wrinkled with care
i kiss the dear fingers so toilworn for me oh god bless you and keep you mother machree
her children arise up and call her blessed
fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soaponarope
definition of fathers day same as mothers day but you dont spend as much
my folks refused to have more than four children after reading that every fifth child born in the world is chinese
no matter what dad was always there with solid words of advice


go ask your mother
father reading report card one thing in your favor   with these grades you couldnt possibly be cheating
every small boy wonders why his father didnt go into the ice cream business
no matter how old a mother is she still watches her middleaged children for signs of improvement
there are three books my daughter felt were the most important influences in her life the bible her mothers cookbook and her fathers checkbook
grandchildren dont make a man feel old its the knowledge that hes married to a grandmother
dad named his first ulcer after me
it is a wise child that knows its own father and an unusual one that unreservedly approves of him
before i got married i had six theories about bringing up children now i have six children and no theories
when i was a boy of fourteen my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around
but when i got to be twentyone i was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years
my mother phones daily to ask did you just try to reach me
when i reply no she adds so if youre not too busy call me while im still alive


and hangs up
most men are secretly still mad at their mothers for throwing away their comic books
they would be valuable now

tis distance lends enchantment to the view and robes the mountain in its azure hue
to make a mountain of a molehill
if the mountain wont come to mohammed mohammed must go to the mountain
the mountain was in labour and jove was afraid but it brought forth a mouse
blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
by the waters of babylon we sat down and wept remembering thee
he mourns the dead who lives as they desire
the mouse that hath but one hole is quickly taken

canned music is like audible wallpaper

chamber music  a conversation between friends
mozart is the human incarnation of the divine force of creation

i think popular music in this country is one of the few things in the twentieth century that have made giant strides in reverse
if a literary man puts together two words about music one of them will be wrong
music is given to us specifically to make order of things to move from an anarchic individualistic state to a regulated perfectly concious one which alone insures vitality and durability
music should strike fire from the heart of man and bring tears from the eyes of woman
music hath charms to soothe the savage breast
soprano basso even the contralto wished him five fathom under the rialto
music is well said to be the speech of angels

and lo
ben adhems name led all the rest
he left the name at which the world grew pale to point a moral or adorn a tale

flowers have an expression of countenance as much as men or animals
some seem to smile some have a sad expression some are pensive and diffident others again are plain honest and upright
gie me a spark o natures fire thats a the learning i desire
light may be shed on man and his origins
i have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term natural selection
the expression often used by mr herbert spencer of the survival of the fittest is more accurate and is sometimes equally convenient
nature is reckless of the individual
when she has points to carry she carries them
i wanted to say something about the universe
theres god angels plants and horseshit
when elephants fight it is the grass that suffers
the dinosaurs eloquent lesson is that if some bigness is good an overabundance of bigness is not necessarily better
who are we
we find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people
a vacuum is a hell of a lot better than some of the stuff that nature replaces it with
we cannot command nature except by obeying her
the mastery of nature is vainly believed to be an adequate substitute for selfmastery
nature thrives on patience man on impatience
the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free
what mighty battles have i seen and heard waged between the trees and the west wind  an iliad fought in the fields of air
grass is the forgiveness of nature  her constant benediction
forests decay harvests perish flowers vanish but grass is immortal
i frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or an old acquaintance among the pines
the whole of nature is a conjugation of the verb to eat in the active and passive
the universe is like a safe to which there is a combination but the combination is locked up in the safe
when the oak is felled the whole forest echoes with its fall but a hundred acorns are sown in silence by an unnoticed breeze
deep in their roots all flowers keep the light
by natures kindly disposition most questions which it is beyond mans power to answer do not occur to him at all
to demand sense is the hallmark of nonsense
nature does not make sense
nothing makes sense
the bluebird carries the sky on his back
there is nothing in which the birds differ more from man than the way in which they can build and yet leave a landscape as it was before
the greatest joy in nature is the absence of man
when a man wantonly destroys a work of man we call him a vandal when a man destroys one of the works of god we call him a sportsman
man is a complex being he makes deserts bloom and lakes die
nature never did betray the heart that loved her
gods miracles are to be found in nature itself the wind and waves the wood that becomes a tree  all of these are explained biologically but behind them is the hand of god
when i first open my eyes upon the morning meadows and look out upon the beautiful world i thank god i am alive
if you wish to know the divine feel the wind on your face and the warm sun on your hand
the radiance in some places is so great as to be fairly dazzling


every crystal every flower a window opening into heaven a mirror reflecting the creator
nature is too thin a screen the glory of the omnipresent god bursts through everywhere
i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars
look deep deep into nature and then you will understand everything better
come forth into the light of things
let nature be your teacher
if you watch how nature deals with adversity continually renewing itself you cant help but learn
rivers and rocks and trees have always been talking to us but weve forgotten how to listen
speak to the earth and it shall teach thee
adopt the pace of nature her secret is patience
climb the mountains and get their good tidings natures peace will flow into you as sunshine into flowers the winds will blow their freshness into you and the storms their energy and cares will drop off like autumn leaves
nature tops the list of potent tranquilizers and stress reducers
the mere sound of moving water has been shown to lower blood pressure
the sun  my almighty physician
nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry
the finest workers in stone are not copper or steel tools but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time
to the dull mind all nature is leaden
to the illumined mind the whole world burns and sparkles with light
the beauty of the world and the orderly arrangement of everything celestial makes us confess that there is an excellent and eternal nature which ought to be worshiped and admired by all mankind
in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
the sun gives us light but the moon provides inspiration
if you look at the sun without shielding your eyes youll go blind
if you look at the moon without covering your eyes youll become a poet
the world is full of poetry
the air is living with its spirit and the waves dance to the music of its melodies and sparkle in its brightness
the sky is the daily bread of the eyes
my heart leaps up when i behold a rainbow in the sky
the bluebird carries the sky on his back
the clearest way into the universe is through a forest wilderness
we lose our souls if we lose the experience of the forest the butterflies the song of the birds if we cant see the stars at night
forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair
as long as the earth can make a spring every year i can
as long as the earth can flower and produce nurturing fruit i can because im the earth
i wont give up until the earth gives up
the creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn
i never knew how soothing trees are  many trees and patches of open sunlight and tree presences it is almost like having another being
nature is saturated with deity
our lord has written the promise of resurrection not in books alone but in every leaf of springtime
the nicest thing about the promise of spring is that sooner or later shell have to keep it
spring is natures way of saying lets party
it was one of those perfect summer days  the sun was shining a breeze was blowing the birds were singing and the lawnmower was broken
nobody sees a flower  really  it is so small it takes time   we havent time  and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time
consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
the ament of nature is always a flower
next time a sunrise steals your breath or a meadow of flowers leave you speechless remain that way
say nothing and listen as heaven whispers do you like it
i did it just for you
every flower is a soul blossoming in nature
flowers always make people better happier and more helpful they are sunshine food and medicine to the soul
earth laughs in flowers
god almighty first planted a garden
and indeed it is the purest of human pleasures
pleasure for an hour a bottle of wine pleasure for a year marriage pleasure for a lifetime a garden
the kiss of sun for pardon the song of the birds for mirth one is nearer gods heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth
all gardeners live in beautiful places because they make them so
all gardening is landscape painting
what is a weed
a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered
for many years i was selfappointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully though i never received one cent for it
the next time it begins to rain  lie down on your belly nestle your chin into the grass and get a frogseye view of how raindrops fall


the sight of hundreds of blades of grass bowing down and popping back up like piano keys strikes me as one of the merriest sights in the world
sunshine is delicious rain is refreshing wind braces us up snow is exhilarating there is really no such thing as bad weather only different kinds of good weather
dont knock the weather ninetenths of the people couldnt start a conversation if it didnt change once in a while
after rain comes fair weather
weather means more when you have a garden
theres nothing like listening to a shower and thinking how it is soaking in around your green beans
this is the day the lord had made
we will rejoice and be glad in it
i have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day a fresh try one more start with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning
whether one is twenty forty or sixty whether one has succeeded failed or just muddled along whether yesterday was full of sun or storm or one of those dull days with no weather at all life begins each morning i
today a new sun rises for me everything lives everything is animated everything seems to speak to me of my passion everything invites me to cherish it
every new day begins with possibilities
its up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace
i love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much i can accomplish
thank god ever morning when you get up that you have something to do which must be done whether you like it or not
today is a new day
you will get out of it just what you put into it


if you have made mistakes even serious mistakes there is always another chance for you



for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down
finish each day and be done with it
you have done what you could some blunders and absurdities have crept in forget them as soon as you can
tomorrow is a new day you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense
live your life each day as you would climb a mountain
an occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point
climb slowly steadily enjoying each passing moment and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey
nothing is worth more than this day
write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year
normal day let me be aware of the treasure you are
let me learn from you love you bless you before you depart
let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow
yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose
when all else is lost the future still remains
when i look at the future its so bright it burns my eyes
earths crammed with heaven and every common bush afire with god
to him who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms she speaks a various language
i love not man the less but nature more
for art may err but nature cannot miss
the woods were made for the hunter of dreams the brooks for the fishes of song
nature is a volume of which god is the author
nature like a kind and smiling mother lends herself to our dreams and cherishes our fancies
accuse not nature she hath done her part do thou but thine
grass is the forgiveness of nature  her constant benediction
forests decay harvests perish flowers vanish but grass is immortal
everything in nature acts in conformity with law
nature abhors a vacuum
to hold as t were the mirror up to nature
i chatter chatter as i flow to join the brimming river for men may come and men may go but i go on forever
when i would recreate myself i seek the darkest wood the thickest and most interminable and to the citizen most dismal swamp
i enter a swamp as a sacred place   a sanctum sanctorum
there is the strength the marrow of nature
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
nature has always had more force than education
o pilot
tis a fearful night theres danger on the deep
the winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators
oh i am a cook and a captain bold and the mate of the nancy brig and a bosun tight and a midshipmate and the crew of the captains gig
thus i steer my bark and sail on even keel with gentle gale
hearts of oak are our ships hearts of oak are our men
now landsmen all whoever you may be if you want to rise to the top of the tree
if your soul isnt fettered to an office stool be careful to be guided by this golden rule   stick close to your desks and never go to to sea and you may all be rulers of the queens navee
necessity has no law
necessity the mother of invention
necessity is often the spur to genius
necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom
it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
necessity makes even the timid brave
not for myself i make this prayer but for this race of mine that stretches forth from shadowed places dark hands for bread and wine
the image of god cut in ebony
o black and unknown bards of long ago how came your lips to touch the sacred fire
how in your darkness did you come to know the power and beauty of the minstrels lyre
in the negro countenance you will often meet with strong traits of benignity
i have felt yearnings of tenderness towards some of these faces
the best way to uncolor the negro is to give the white man a white heart
the negro is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world and he has deep in his heart a passion for all that is splendid rich and fanciful
we can live without our friends but not without our neighbors
when your neighbors house is afire your own property is at stake
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
the crop always seems better in our neighbors field and our neighbors cow gives more milk
in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor
the cold neutrality of an impartial judge
neutrality as a lasting principle is an evidence of weakness
a wise neuter joins with neither but uses both as his honest interest leads him
the heart is never neutral
a plague o both your houses
a man never tells you anything until you contradict him
laws die books never
we are never deceived we deceive ourselves
the english never draw a line without blurring it
deep experience is never peaceful

i like to visit new york but i wouldnt live there if you gave it to me
if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptownonthehudson called new york
vulgar of manner overfed
overdressed and underbred heartless godless hells delight rude by day and lewd by night bedwarfed the man oergrown the brute ruled by boss and prostitute purplerobed and pauperclad raving rotting moneymad a squirming herd in mammons mesh a wilderness of human flesh crazed with avarice lust and rum new york thy names delirium
spick and span new
what is valuable is not new and what is new is not valuable
if a man bites a dog that is news
by evil report and good report
as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country
theres villainous news abroad
when we hear news we should always wait for the sacrament of confirmation
freedom of the press in britain is freedom to print such of the proprietors prejudices as the advertisers dont object to
newspapers have developed what might be called a vested interest in catastrophe
if they can spot a fight they play up that fight
if they can uncover a tragedy they will headline that tragedy
everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true except for that rare story of which you happen to have firsthand knowledge
i do not take a single newspaper nor read one a month and i feel myself infinitely the happier for it
burke said there were three estates in parliament but in the reporters gallery yonder there sat a fourth estate more important than them all
comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
remember son many a good story has been ruined by oververification
dont be afraid to make a mistake your readers might like it
one newspaper a day ought to be enough for anyone who still prefers to retain a little mental balance
journalism is literature in a hurry
the sports page records peoples accomplishments the front page usually records nothing but mans failures
if some great catastrophe is not announced every morning we feel a certain void
nothing in the paper today we sigh
carelessness is not fatal to journalism nor are cliches for the eye rests lightly on them
but what is intended to be read once can seldom be read more than once a journalist has to accept the fact that his work by its very todayness is excluded from any share in tomorrow
he had been kicked in the head by a mule when young and believed everything he read in the sunday papers
an editor  a person employed on a newspaper whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff and to see that the chaff is printed
the day you write to please everyone you no longer are in journalism
you are in show business
news is the first rough draft of history
it is a newspapers duty to print the news and raise hell
what you see is news what you know is background what you feel is opinion
freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
a good newspaper is a nation talking to itself
the first essence of journalism is to know what you want to know the second is to find out who will tell you
todays reporter is forced to become an educator more concerned with explaining the news than with being first on the scene
a writer who takes up journalism abandons the slow tempo of literature for a faster one and the change will do him harm
by degrees the flippancy of journalism will become a habit and the pleasure of being paid on the nail and more especially of being praised on the nail grow indispensable
newspapers are the worlds mirrors
were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter
every editor of newspapers pays tribute to the devil
four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets
let me make the newspapers and i care not what is preached in the pulpit or what is enacted in congress
ah i know is what i see in the papers
the night has a thousand eyes the day but one yet the light of the bright world dies with the dying sun
for the night shows stars and women in a better light
nights black mantle covers all alike
watchman what of the night
night when deep sleep falleth on men
the night cometh when no man can work
and the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the arabs and as silently steal away
in a real dark night of the soul it is always three oclock in the morning
the nearer the dawn the darker the night
the night is dark and i am far from home
to all to each a fair good night and pleasing dreams and slumbers light
making night hideous
it is the hour when from the boughs the nightingales high note is heard it is the hour when lovers vows seem sweet in every whisperd word
hark
thats the nightingale telling the selfsame tale her song told when this ancient earth was young so echoes answered when her song was sung in the first wooded vale
the angel of spring the mellowthroated nightingale
i am not the smartest or most talented person in the world but i succeeded because i keep going and going and going
i know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen
victory belongs to the most persevering
success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed
success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go
if you wish success in life make perseverance your bosom friend
they who are the most persistent and work in the true spirit will invariably be the most successful
if at first you dont succeed try try try again
if at first you dont succeed youre running about average
the secret of success is constancy of purpose
the only way to the top is by persistent intelligent hard work
the heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight but they while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night
i realized early on that success was tied to not giving up
most people in this business gave up and went on to other things
if you simply didnt give up you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you
call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful business giants and if you know anything about their careers you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits
edison went hungry many times before he became famous
perseverance is a great element of success
if you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody
four steps to achievement plan purposefully prepare prayerfully proceed positively pursue persistently
flaming enthusiasm backed up by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success
diamonds are only lumps of coal that stuck to their jobs
persistence is the master virtue
without it there is no other
im hardnosed about luck
i think it sucks
yeah if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter and then one day somebody gives you a job you can say gee i was lucky i happened to go up there today
but dammit i was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years

if youre persistent in trying and doing and working you almost make your own fortune
its the plugging away that will win you the day so dont be a piker old pard
just draw on your grit its so easy to quit its the keeping your chin up thats hard
no one succeeds without effort
those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance
big shots are only little shots who keep shooting
be of good cheer
do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow
you have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles
remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost
the way to succeed is never quit
thats it
but really be humble about it you start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there
there are no shortcuts to any place worth going
continuous effortsnot strength or intelligenceis the key to unlocking our potential
plodding wins the race
the difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow
let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal my strength lies solely in my tenacity
a winner never quits and a quitter never wins
men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose
as a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck
in the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm in the real world all rests on perseverance
theres such a thin line between winning and losing
it is easier to begin well than to finish well
the great majority of men are bundles of beginnings
i hope i shall have ambition until the day i die
when you put your hand to the plow you cant put it down until you get to the end of the row
out of the strain of the doing into the peace of the done
great is the art of beginning but greater is the art of ending
there are two parts to the creative endeavor making something then disseminating it
we rate ability in men by what they finish not by what they begin
a chicken doesnt stop scratching just because worms are scarce
everyone has his superstitions
one of mine has always been when i started to go anywhere or to do anything never to turn back or to stop until the thing intended was accomplished
i just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing
the real question is why did other people stop
men perish because they cannot join the beginning with the end
business is full of brilliant men who started out with a spurt and lacked the stamina to finish
their places were taken by patient and unshowy plodders who never knew when to quit
i can remember walking as a child
it was not customary to say you were fatigued
it was customary to complete the goal of the expedition
he that has cut the claws of the lion will not feel quite secure until he has also drawn his teeth
courage to start and willingness to keep everlasting at it are the requisites for success
i went for years not finishing anything
because of course when you finish something you can be judged
i had poems which were rewritten so many times i suspect it was just a way of avoiding sending them out
let no one til his death be called unhappy
measure not the work until the days out and the labor done then bring your gauges
all is well that ends well
either do not attempt at all or go through with it
in soloingas in other activitiesit is far easier to start something than it is to finish it
it is a matter first of beginningand then following through
genius begins great works labor alone finishes it
there is but an inch of difference between the cushioned chamber and the padded cell
the only way to find out if you can write is to set aside a certain period every day and try
save enough money to give yourself six months to be a fulltime writer
work every day and the pages will pile up
i work every dayor at least i force myself into my office or room
i may get nothing done but you dont earn bonuses without putting in time
nothing may come for three months but you dont earn the fourth without it
when nothing seems to help i go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it
yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two and i know it was not that blow that did it but all that had gone before
the drops of rain make a hole in the stone not by violence but by oft falling
it does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop
live with no time out
the great thing in this world is not so much where we are but in what direction we are moving
the race is not always to the swift but to those who keep on running
my parents told me that people will never know how long it takes you to do something
they will only know how well it is done
by perseverance the snail reached the ark
our desire must be like a slow and stately ship sailing across endless oceans never in search of safe anchorage
then suddenly unexpectedly it will find mooring for a moment
the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong
if we are facing in the right direction all we have to do is keep on walking
its the steady constant driving to the goal for which youre striving not the speed with which you travel that will make your victory sure
im a slow walker but i never walk back
slow and steady wins the race
character is built into the spiritual fabric of personality hour by hour day by day year by year in much the same deliberate way that physical health is built into the body
no great thing is created suddenly
be content to grow a little each day
if the improvement is the sort of thing which is very slow do not measure it too often
do a selfcomparison every two weeks or every six months whatever is appropriate
pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it
wisely and slow
they stumble that run fast
plodding wins the race
the way of progress is neither swift nor easy
one thing at a time all things in succession
that which grows slowly endures
make haste slowly
slow motion gets you there faster
im not there yet but im closer than i was yesterday
life begins on the other side of despair
i am suffocated and lost when i have not the bright feeling of progression
the lowest ebb is the turn of the tide
you give ioo percent in the first half of the game and if that isnt enough in the second half you give whats left
dont get hung up on a snag in the stream my dear
snags are not so dangerousits the debris that clings to them that makes the trouble
pull yourself loose and go on
one can go a long way after one is tired
the great thing and the hard thing is to stick to things when you have outlived the first interest and not yet got the second which comes with a sort of mastery
effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit
if something is boring after two minutes try it for four
if still boring try for eight sixteen thirtytwo and so on
eventually one discovers that it is not boring but very interesting
no one ever did anything worth doing unless he was prepared to go on with it long after it became something of a bore
ive been failing for like ten or eleven years
when it turns itll turn
right now im just tryin to squeeze through a very tight financial period get the movie out and put my things in order
in our day when a pitcher got into trouble in a game instead of taking him out our manager would leave him in and tell him to pitch his way out of trouble
im a little wounded but i am not slain i will lay me down to bleed a while
then ill rise and fight again
the tragedy of life is not that man loses but that he almost wins
where i am today has everything to do with the years i spent hanging on to a career by my fingernails
courage is fear holding on a minute longer
a hero is no braver than an ordinary man but he is brave five minutes longer
hope says to us constantly go on go on and leads us to the grave
every great work every big accomplishment has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision and often just before the big achievement comes apparent failure and discouragement
the line between failure and success is so fine that we  are often on the line and do not know it
how many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort a little more patience would have achieved success
a little more persistence a little more effort and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success
when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
it is with enterprises as with striking fire we do not meet with success except with reiterated efforts and often at the instant when we despaired of success
saints are sinners who kept on going
we can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough
when you get into a tight place and everything goes against you til it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer never give up then for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn
men do not fail they stop trying
it aint over til its over
triumph often is nearest when defeat seems inescapable
dont bother about genius
dont worry about being clever
trust to hard work perseverance and determination
and the best motto for a long march is dont grumble
plug on
some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal while others on the contrary obtain a victory by exerting at the last moment more vigorous efforts than before
never stop
one always stops as soon as something is about to happen
many of lifes failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
fight one more round
when your feet are so tired you have to shuffle back to the center of the ring fight one more round
dont leave before the miracle happens
if something doesnt come up the way you want you have to forge ahead
fortune is like the market where many times if you can stay a little the price will fall
this man wellington is so stupid he does not know when he is beaten and goes on fighting
he never knew when he was whipped  so he never was
entrepreneurs average 38 failures before a final success
what sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence
there are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat
as long as a person doesnt admit he is defeated he is not defeatedhes just a little behind and isnt through fighting
only yield when you must never give up the ship but fight on to the last with a stiff upper lip
defeat never comes to any man until he admits it
there is something in mei just cant stand to admit defeat
there was no such thing as defeat if you didnt accept it
never give in
never give in
never never never never
in nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions or honor and good sense
first there are those who are winners and know they are winners
then there are the losers who know they are losers
then there are those who are not winners but dont know it
theyre the ones for me
they never quit trying
theyre the soul of our game
its not worthy of human beings to give up
never admit defeat
we shall go on to the end
we shall fight in france we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the halls
we shall never surrender
patient endurance attends to all things
to be somebody you must last
he conquers who endures
emotional maturity is the ability to stick to a job and to struggle through until it is finished to endure unpleasantness discomfort and frustration
to bear is to conquer our fate
keep breathing
it helps i think to consider ourselves on a very long journey the main thing is to keep to the faith to endure to help each other when we stumble or tire to weep and press on
the first and final thing you have to do in this world is to last in it and not be smashed by it
the first need of being is endurance to endure with gladness if we can with fortitude in any event
i bend but i do not break
he that endureth to the end shall be saved
whatever necessity lays upon thee endure whatever she commands do
to be somebody you must last
in the clutch of circumstance i have not winced or cried aloud under the bludgeoning of chance my head is bloody but unbowed
we shall live to fight again and to strike another blow
giving up is the ultimate tragedy
god almighty hates a quitter
endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes
endure and preserve yourselves for better things
every kind of fortune is to be overcome by bearing it
when we see ourselves in a situation which must be endured and gone through it is best to make up our minds to meet it with firmness and accommodate everything to it in the best way practical
this lessons the evil while fretting and fuming only serve to increase your own torments
if you want to see the sun shine you have to weather the storm
if you want the rainbow you gotta put up with the rain
what cannot be altered must be borne not blamed
he that cant endure the bad will not live to see the good
to struggle when hope is banished
to live when lifes salt is gone
to dwell in a dream thats vanished to endure and go calmly on
a high heart ought to bear calamities and not flee them since in bearing them appears the grandeur of the mind and in fleeing them the cowardice of the heart
endurance is nobler than strength and patience than beauty
they merit more praise who know how to suffer misery than those who temper themselves with contentment
we must endure what fortune sends
people can bear anything
we must learn from life how to suffer it
this is courage in a man to bear unflinchingly what heaven sends
man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit
obstacles cannot crush me every obstacle yields to stern resolve
and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not
hold on with a bulldog grip and chew and choke as much as possible
there remain times when one can only endure
one lives on one doesnt die and the only thing that one can do is to fill ones mind and time as far as possible with the concerns of other people
it doesnt bring immediate peace but it brings the dawn nearer
when i look at the kids training today
i can tell which ones are going to do well
its not necessarily the ones who have the most natural talent or who fall the least
sometimes its the kids who fall the most and keep pulling themselves up and trying again
our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising every time we fall
it takes far less courage to kill yourself than it takes to make yourself wake up one more time
success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall
if i dont get off the mat ill lose the fight
for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again
persistent people begin their success where others end in failure
think of a fine painter attempting to capture an inner vision beginning with one corner of the canvas painting what he thinks should be there not quite pulling it off covering it over with white paint and trying again each time finding out what his painting isnt until he finally finds out what it is
and when you finally do find out what one corner of your vision is youre off and running
vitality shows not only in the ability to persist but in the ability to start over
regression in grief must be seen and supported as a means toward adaptation and health
to be happy drop the words if only and substitute instead the words next time
life is a maze in which we take the wrong turning before we learn to walk
education is hanging around until youve caught on
never go to bed mad
stay up and fight
you go back to the gym and you just do it again and again until you get it right
as long as one keeps searching the answers come
how many years you have to keep on doing until you know what to do and how to do
there is no wisdom equal to that which comes after the event
tolerate the  process of coming to knowledge or certainty or clarity through sometimes apparently hopeless thickets of confusion or bewilderment
learn not to be surprised or disheartened by the muddle you inhabit and not to press too soon for a superficial reprieve
learn to selfconquest persevere thus for a time and you will perceive very clearly the advantage which you gain from it
what can any of us do with his talent but try to develop his vision so that through frequent failures we may learn better what we have missed in the past
all effort is in the last analysis sustained by faith that it is worth making
competition is easier to accept if you realize it is not an act of oppression or abrasion

ive worked with my best friends in direct competition
life has no smooth road for any of us and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend over steep ways to the stars fulfills itself
the one who cares the most wins
thats how i knew id end up with everyone else waving the white flags and not me
thats how i knew id be the last person standing when it was all over

i cared the most
if i had refused to institute a negotiation or had not persevered in it i would have been degraded in my own estimation as a man of honor
i read my own books sometimes to cheer me when it is hard to write and then i remember that it was always difficult and how nearly impossible it was sometimes
the difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one comes from a strong will and the other from a strong wont
when youre a professional you come back no matter what happened the day before
we can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough
what do you want most to do
thats what i have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties
desire and hope will push us on toward the future
the champ may have lost his stuff temporarily or permanently he cant be sure
when he can no longer throw his high hard one he throws his heart instead
he throws something
he just doesnt walk off the mound and weep
we attempt nothing great but from a sense of the difficulties we have to encounter we persevere in nothing great but from a pride in overcoming them
he turns not back who is bound to a star
what helps me go forward is that i stay receptive i feel that anything can happen
there was a texas ranger one time who said that theres no stopping a man who knows hes in the right and keeps acoming
when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot in it and hang on
whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong
there are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right
to map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires  courage
people with good intentions never give up
if i see a door comin my way im knockin it down
and if i cant knock down the door im sliding through the window
all my life ive been competingand competing to win
i came to realize that in this way this cancer was the toughest competition i had faced yet
i made up my mind that i was going to lick it all the way
i not only wasnt going to let it kill me i wasnt even going to let it put me on the shelf
i have accepted fear as a part of lifespecifically the fear of change

i have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope
the unifying of opposites is the eternal process
brave admiral say but one good word what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leapt like a leaping sword sail on
sail on
and on
in hollywood all marriages are happy
its trying to live together afterwards that causes problems
we must dare and dare again and go on daring
austere perseverance harsh and continuous may be employed by the least of us and rarely fails of its purpose for its silent power grows irresistibly greater with time
grant me the courage not to give up even though i think it is hopeless
i try
i am trying
i was trying
i will try
i shall in the meantime try
i sometimes have tried
i shall still by that time be trying
hard times aint quit and we aint quit
all the sugar was in the bottom of the cup
i have often been adrift but i have always stayed afloat
god helps those who persevere
gnaw your own bone gnaw at it bury it unearth it gnaw it still
like ships men flounder time and time again
to strive to seek to find and not to yield
to keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it
if you stop struggling then you stop life
one thing we learned
to make a start and keep plugging
when i had fights at school the little while i went i just bowed my neck and kept swinging until something hit the dirt
sometimes it was me but i always got up
jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer
men must be in earnest when they kneel at gods footstool
too often we get fainthearted and quit praying at the point when we ought to begin
we let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest
our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will
be strong
it matters not how deep entrenched the wrong how hard the battle goes the day how long faint notfight on
tomorrow comes the song
never grow a wishbone daughter where your backbone ought to be
good people are good because theyve come to wisdom through failure
you may have to fight a battle more than once to win it
send your noble blood to market and see what it will bring
noble blood is an accident of fortune noble actions characterize the great
be noble in every thought and in every deed
this was the noblest roman of them all
a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
the owl and the pussycat went to sea in a beautiful peagreen boat
no one is exempt from talking nonsense the misfortune is to do it solemnly
plain as a nose in a mans face
give me a man with a good allowance of nose when i want any good headwork done i choose a man  provided his education has been suitable  with a long nose
if the nose of cleopatra had been a little shorter the whole face of the world would have been changed
nothing to do but work nothing to eat but food nothing to wear but clothes to keep one from going nude
blessed be he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed
they laboriously do nothing
a life of nothings nothing worth from that first nothing ere his birth to that last nothing under earth
you can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it
tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vowd true
ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
obedience alone gives the right to command
let they childs first lesson be obedience and the second will be what thou wilt
women are perfectly well aware that the more they seem to obey the more they rule
let them obey that know not how to rule
the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it
i give the fight up let there be an end a privacy an obscure nook for me i want to be forgotten even by god
full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air
how happy is the blameless vestals lot
the world forgetting by the world forgot
how many a rustic milton has passed by stifling the speechless longings of his heart in unremitting drudgery and care
how many a vulgar cato has compelled his energies no longer tameless then to mold a pin or fabricate a nail
thus let me live unseen unknown thus unlamented let me die steal from the world and not a stone tell where i lie
tis distance lends enchantment to the view and robes the mountain in its azure hue
all of us are watchers  of television of time clocks of traffic on the freeway  but few are observers
everyone is looking not many are seeing
as a man is so he sees
my evening visitors if they cannot see the clock should find the time in my face
i keep six honest servingmen they taught me all i know their names are what and why and when and how and where and who
i rather like the world
the flesh is pleasing and the devil does not trouble me
it is the theory that decides what can be observed
mystery is not profoundness
the difference between landscape and landscape is small but theres a great difference in the beholders
the eyes are the window of the soul
to survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us
the eyes believe themselves the ears believe other people
the eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend
the things we see are the minds best bet as to what is out front
you can observe a lot just by watching
the eye is the jewel of the body
the ear tends to be lazy craves the familiar and is shocked by the unexpected the eye on the other hand tends to be impatient craves the novel and is bored by repetition
the eyes indicate the antiquity of the soul
to become the spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of life
one must always tell what one sees
above all which is more difficult one must always see what one sees
a fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees
cultivated men and women who do not skim the cream of life and are attached to the duties yet escape the harsher blows make acute and balanced observers
people only see what they are prepared to see
the lower classes of men though they do not think it worthwhile to record what they perceive nevertheless perceive everything that is worth noting the difference between them and a man of learning often consists in nothing more than the latters facility for expression
theres none so blind as those who wont see
obstinacy and vehemency in opinion are the surest proofs of stupidity
an obstinate man does not hold opinions but they hold him
i hold every man a debtor to his profession from the which as men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit so ought they of duty to endeavor themselves by way of amends to be a help and ornament thereunto
the crowning fortune of a man is to be born to some pursuit which finds him employment and happiness whether it be to make baskets or broadswords or canals or statues or songs
the ugliest of trades have their moments of pleasure
now if i were a gravedigger or even a hangman there are some people i could work for with a great deal of enjoyment
full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear
the breaking waves dashed high on a stern and rockbound coast
and the woods against a stormy sky their giant branches tossd
love the sea
i dote upon it  from the beach
praise the sea but keep on land
rocked in the cradle of the deep i lay me down in peace to sleep
the very essence of a free government consists in considering offices as public trusts bestowed for the good of the country and not for the benefit of an individual or a party
if a due participation of office is a matter of right how are vacancies to be obtained
those by death are few by resignation none
this struggle and scramble for office for a way to live without work will finally test the strength of our institutions
the insolence of office
no one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow
youth troubles over eternity age grasps at a day and is satisfied to have even the day
nothing is worth more than this day
i have come to understand that every day is something to cherish
what a folly to dread the thought of throwing away life at once and yet have no regard to throwing it away by parcels and piecemeal
not a day passes over this earth but men and women of note do great deeds speak great words and suffer noble sorrows
we create our fate every day we live
who loses a day loses life
may you live all the days of your life
if we only knew the real value of a day
we are involved in a life that passes understanding our highest business is our daily life
we die daily
happy those who daily come to life as well
he who has lived a day has lived an age
life we learn too late is in the living in the tissue of every day and hour
to sensible men every day is a day of reckoning
a days impact is better than a month of dead pull
they deem me mad because i will not sell my days for gold and i deem them mad because they think my days have a price
the proper function of man is to live not to exist
i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them
a day an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity in bondage
live mindful of how brief your life is
gladly accept the gifts of the present hour
everyone once once only
just once and no more
and we also once
never again
most of us spend our lives as if we had another one in the bank
its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life
while we live let us live
no objects of value  are worth risking the priceless experience of waking up one more day
every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour
some days you tame the tiger
and some days the tiger has you for lunch
so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
you have got to own your days and live them each one of them every one of them or else the years go right by and none of them belong to you
the ideal never comes
today is ideal for him who makes it so
true wisdom lies in gathering the precious things out of each day as it goes by
the most important thing in our lives is what we are doing now
write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year
he possesses dominion over himself and is happy who can every day say i have lived
tomorrow the heavenly father may either involve the world in dark clouds or cheer it with clear sunshine he will not however render ineffectual the things which have already taken place
each day each hour an entire life
the days come and go like muffled and veiled figures sent from a distant friendly party but they say nothing and if we do not use the gifts they bring they carry them as silently away
your daily life is your temple and your religion
he is only rich who owns the day
there is no king rich man fairy or demon who possesses such power as that
life is now  this day this hour  and is probably the only experience of the kind one is to have
gather ye rosebuds while ye may old time is still aflying
and this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying
seize the hour
time like money is measured by our needs
nothing is ours except time
nothing in business is so valuable as time
many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it and others do just the same with their time
possessions dwindle i mourn their loss
but i mourn the loss of time much more for anyone can save his purse but none can win back lost time
riches are chiefly good because they give us time
one realizes the full importance of time only when there is little of it left
every mans greatest capital asset is his unexpired years of productive life
know the true value of time snatch seize and enjoy every moment of it
no idleness no laziness no procrastination never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
a sense of the value of time  is an essential preliminary to efficient work it is the only method of avoiding hurry
all my possessions for a moment of time
let me tell thee time is a very precious gift of god so precious that its only given to us moment by moment
pick my left pocket of its silver dime but spare the rightit holds my golden time
we work not only to produce but to give value to time
dollars cannot buy yesterday
as every thread of gold is valuable so is every moment of time
minutes are worth more than money
spend them wisely
time is the coin of your life
it is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent
be careful lest you let other people spend it for you
every minute of life carries with it its miraculous value and its face of eter1nal youth
lost time is never found again
if a person gives you his time he can give you no more precious gift
you may ask me for anything you like except time
the laboring man and the artificer knows what every hour of his time is worth and parts not with it but for the full value
time isnt a commodity something you pass around like cake
time is the substance of life
when anyone asks you to give your time theyre really asking for a chunk of your life
love and timethose are the only two things in all the world and all of life that cannot be bought but only spent
there is nothing good in this world which time does not improve
time is the most valuable thing a man can spend
the great rule of moral conduct is next to god to respect time
it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important
one hour of life crowded to the full with glorious action and filled with noble risks is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum
dont be fooled by the calendar
there are only as many days in the year as you make use of
one man gets only a weeks value out of a year while another man gets a full years value out of a week
our costliest expenditure is time
the importance of using time well how pleasant it is at the end of the day no follies to have to repent but reflect on the past and be able to say that my time has been properly spent
i must govern the clock not be governed by it
you are no more exempt from times inexorable passing than macbeth
whether time is your friend or foe depends on how you use it
millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with themselves on a rainy sunday afternoon
the organized person  makes the most of his time and goes to his bed for the night perfectly relaxed for rest and renewal
have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well
then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life will become a beautiful success
he who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows out that plan carries a thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life

if the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident chaos will soon reign
have a time and place for everything and do everything in its time and place and you will not only accomplish more but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying
it is not how many years we live but rather what we do with them
during a very busy life i have often been asked how did you manage to it all
the answer is very simple it is because i did everything promptly
time cannot be expanded accumulated mortgaged hastened or retarded
seize time by the forelock
time is a tyranny to be abolished
the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up the rest
the ability to concentrate and to use time well is everything
time is an equal opportunity employer
each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day
rich people cant buy more hours
scientists cant invent new minutes
and you cant save time to spend it on another day
even so time is amazingly fair and forgiving
no matter how much time youve wasted in the past you still have an entire tomorrow
success depends upon using it wiselyby planning and setting priorities
an italian philosopher said that time was his estate an estate indeed which will produce nothing without cultivation but will always abundantly repay the labors of industry and generally satisfy the most extensive desires if no part of it be suffered to lie in waste by negligence to be overrun with noxious plants or laid out for show rather than for use
timely service like timely gifts is doubled in value
time is the one thing that can never be retrieved
we must use time as a tool not as a crutch
make use of time let not advantage slip
o for an engine to keep back all clocks
you may delay but time will not
he who would make serious use of his life must always act as though he had a long time to live and schedule his time as though he were about to die
the highest value in life is found in the stewardship of time
a stale mind is the devils breadbox
i wish i could stand on a busy corner hat in hand and beg people to throw me all their wasted hours
every day i live i am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given the powers we have not used the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which shirking pain misses happiness as well
wasted time means wasted lives
regret for time wasted can become a power for good in the time that remains if we will only stop the waste and the idle useless regretting
economy is the thief of time
i wasted time and now doth time waste me
all that time is lost which might be better employed
lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset two golden hours each set with sixty diamond minutes
no reward is offered for they are gone forever
thrift of time will repay you in afterlife with a usury of profit beyond your most sanguine dreams waste of it will make you dwindle alike in intellectual and moral stature beyond your darkest reckoning
the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
time is lost when we have not lived a full human life time unenriched by experience creative endeavor enjoyment and suffering
still on it creeps each little moment at anothers heels till hours days years and ages are made up of such small parts as these and men look back worn and bewilderd wondering how it is
doest thou love life
then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of
time wasted is a theft from god
lost time is like a run in a stocking
it always gets worse
as if you could kill time without injuring eternity
killing time is the chief end of our society
you can kill time or kill yourself it comes to the same thing in the end
no person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any
time is that which man is always trying to kill but which ends in killing him
do not wait for leaders do it alone person to person
men talk of killing time while time quietly kills them
modern man thinks he loses somethingtimewhen he does not do things quickly
yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains except kill it
if you want to kill time try working it to death
a man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life
if time be of all things most precious wasting time must be the greatest prodigality since lost time is never found again
dont agonize
organize
curse ruthless time
curse our mortality
how cruelly short is the allotted span for all we must cram into it
death and taxes and childbirth
theres never any convenient time for any of them
there is a time for work
and a time for love
that leaves no other time
you will never find time for anything
if you want time you must make it
we have as much time as we need
ah
the clock is always slow it is later than you think
the fortyfourhour week has no charm for me
im looking for a fortyhour day
those who make the worst use of their time most complain of its brevity
i still find each day too short for all the thoughts i want to think all the walks i want to take all the books i want to read and all the friends i want to see
what we love to do we find time to do
time stays long enough for anyone who will use it
there is time for everything
it is nonsense to say there is not enough time to be fully informed
time given to thought is the greatest timesaver of all
we all find time to do what we really want to do
time is a fixed income and as with any income the real problem facing most of us is how to live successfully within our daily allotment
we shall never have more time
we have and have always had all the time there is
no object is served in waiting until next week or even until tomorrow
keep going

concentrate on something useful
there is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time
much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces and which most men throw away
learn to use ten minutes intelligently
it will pay you huge dividends
it is better to do the most trifling thing in the world than to regard half an hour as trifle
i recommend you to take care of the minutes for the hours will take care of themselves
the real secret of how to use time is to pack it as you would a portmanteau filling up the small spaces with small things
one must learn a different sense of time one that depends more on small amounts than big ones
an earnest purpose finds time or makes it
it seizes on spare moments and turns fragments to golden account
guard well your spare moments
they are like uncut diamonds
discard them and their value will never be known
improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life
the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough
that man is happiest who lives from day to day and asks no more garnering the simple goodness of life
it is only possible to live happilyeverafter on a daytoday basis
happiness is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day
all the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today
the best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today
a fool bolts pleasure then complains of indigestion
happiness is to be found along the way not at the end of the road for then the journey is over and it is too late
today this hour this minute is the day the hour the minute for each of us to sense the fact that life is good with all of its trials and troubles and perhaps more interesting because of them
each day provides its own gifts
let us savour the swift delights of the most beautiful of our days
death accompanies us at every step and enables us to use those moments when life smiles at us to feel more deeply the sweetness of life
the more certain the end the more tempting the minute
happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling
my advice to you is not to inquire why or whither but just to enjoy your ice cream while its on your plate
those who face that which is actually before them unburdened by the past undistracted by the future these are they who live who make the best use of their lives these are those who have found the secret of contentment
and that was victory
the freedom to sprawl loosely upon a city street heat his coffee and eat a can of beans  with no enemy bullets forcing him to toss the can aside while diving behind another wall for momentary survival
taking time to live is taking time to appreciate simple silence as better than any kind of talk or watching a flower or watching a guy wash the windows on a skyscraper and wondering what he is thinking
if you observe a really happy man you will find  that he is happy in tiie course of living life twentyfour crowded hours each day
to fill the hour that is happiness to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval
live your life each day as you would climb a mountain
an occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point
climb slowly steadily enjoying each passing moment and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey
one day of pleasure is worth two of sorrow
present joys are more to flesh and blood than the dull prospect of a distant good
in order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past which i often did not fully enjoy because i was comparing them with other moments of the future
live in daytight compartments
if you are not happy here and now you never will be
people who postpone happiness are like children who try chasing rainbows in an effort to find the pot of gold at the rainbows end

your life will never be fulfilled until you are happy here and now
hes one of those christmas eve guys
there are people like that


every day in their lives is christmas eve
learn to drink the cup of life as it comes
every day give yourself a good mental shampoo
there is no other solution to mans progress but the days honest work the days honest decisions the days generous utterances and the days good deed
leisure for reverie gay or somber does much to enrich life
a man should hear a little music read a little poetry and see a fine picture every day of his life in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which god has implanted in the human soul
you have to set new goals every day
i have resolved that from this day on i will do all the business i can honestly have all the fun i can reasonably do all the good i can willingly and save my digestion by thinking pleasantly
make the most of today
translate your good intentions into actual deeds
today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed
do what you can with what you have where you are
our grand business undoubtedly is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand
my formula for living is quite simple
i get up in the morning and i go to bed at night
in between i occupy myself as best i can
what you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do
if we cannot meet our everyday surroundings with equanimity and pleasure and grow each day in some useful direction then  life is on the road toward misfortune misery and destruction
a days work is a days work neither more nor less and the man who does it needs a days sustenance a nights repose and due leisure whether he be painter or ploughman
add each day something to fortify you against poverty and death
it isnt hard to be good from time to time in sports
whats tough is being good every day
make it a point to do something every day that you dont want to do
this is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain
realize life as an end in itself
functioning is all there is
he has not learned the first lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear
a homer a day will boost my pay
act well at the moment and you have performed a good action to all eternity
if i had my life to live over i would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall
i would go to more dances
i would ride more merrygorounds
i would pick more daisies
nothing determines who we will become so much as those things we choose to ignore
love and do what you like
take the time to come home to yourself everyday
the power of a mans virtue should not be measured by his special efforts but by his ordinary doing
the great business of life is to be to do to do without and to depart
know what you want to do hold the thought firmly and do every day what should be done and every sunset will see you that much nearer the goal
it is no easy thing for a principle to become a mans own unless each day he maintains it and works it out in his life
follow your bliss
joseph campbell resolve to perform what you ought
perform without fail what you resolve
resolve to edge in a little reading every day if it is but a single sentence
if you gain fifteen minutes a day it will make itself felt at the end of the year
i work every dayor at least i force myself into my office or room
i may get nothing done but you dont earn bonuses without putting in time
nothing may come for three months but you dont get the fourth without it
take short views hope for the best and trust in god
each day can be one of triumph if you keep up your interests
when action grows unprofitable gather information when information grows unprofitable sleep
i long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble
to do the useful thing to say the courageous thing to contemplate the beautiful thing that is enough for one mans life
showing up is 80 percent of life
do you know that disease and death must needs overtake us no matter what we are doing
what do you wish to be doing when it overtakes you
if you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken get to work on that
have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself
do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew
without duty life is soft and boneless
a man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer and attempting a task he cannot achieve
and each man stands with his face in the light of his own drawn sword
ready to do what a hero can
every day give yourself a good mental shampoo
to look up and not down to look forward and not back to look out and not in and to lend a hand
do all the good you can by all the means you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can
i like the man who faces what he must with steps triumphant and a heart of cheer who fights the daily battle without fear
to accomplish our destiny  we must cover before nightfall the distance assigned to each of us
each day should be passed as though it were our last
learn as if you were going to live forever
live as if you were going to die tomorrow
one should count each day a separate life
if every day i dare to remember that i am here on loan that this house this hillside these minutes are all leased to me not given i will never despair
to live each day as though ones last never flustered never apathetic never attitudinizinghere is perfection of character
look at everything as though you were seeing it for the first time or the last time
then your time on earth will be filled with glory
the years seem to rush by now and i think of death as a fast approaching end of a journeydouble and treble reason for loving as well as working while it is day
study as if you were going to live forever live as if you were going to die tomorrow
every day is a little life  live every day as if it would be the last
those that dare lose a day are dangerously prodigal those that dare misspend it are desperate
you have to count on living every single day in a way you believe will make you feel good about your life so that if it were over tomorrow youd be content with yourself
no one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow
happy the man and happy he alone he who can call today his own he who secure within can say tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today
do your best every day and your life will gradually expand into satisfying fullness
there are only three colors ten digits and seven notes its what we do with them thats important
any mans life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day
do each daily task the best we can act as though the eye of opportunity were always upon us
what a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks
when we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm miracles can happen
look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end
its not a day when you lounge around doing nothing its when youve had everything to do and youve done it
so get a few laughs and do the best you can
i come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability
and when youve done the best you can you cant do any better
so when i go to sleep i turn everything over to the lord and forget it
that man is blest who does his best and leaves the rest
when you rise in the morning form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature
he who allows his day to pass by without practicing generosity and enjoying lifes pleasures is like a blacksmiths bellows he breathes but does not live
you have not lived a perfect day even though you have earned your money unless you have done something for someone who will never be able to repay you
think that day lost whose descending sun views from thy hand no noble action done
i expect to pass through life but once
if therefore there can be any kindness i can show or any good thing i can do to any fellow human being let me do it now
be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity
the most thoroughly wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed
each day and the living of it has to be a conscious creation in which discipline and order are relieved with some play and pure foolishness
sweets are good for the nerves
fat gives things flavor
friends i beg you do not shirk your daily task of indolence
if someone said write a sentence about your life id write i want to go outside and play
we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once
life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time
put a little fun into your life
try dancing
he who does not get fun and enjoyment out of every day  needs to reorganize his life
unless each day can be looked back upon by an individual as one in which he has had some fun some joy some real satisfaction that day is a loss
take time every day to do something silly
its fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day
thats what human life is all aboutenjoying things
come let us give a little time to folly  and even in a melancholy day let us find time for an hour of pleasure
no matter what looms ahead if you can eat today enjoy the sunlight today mix good cheer with friends today enjoy it and bless god for it
be satisfied with a good days work there are hundreds of tasks we feel we must accomplish in the day but if we do not take them one at a time  we are bound to break our own physical or mental structure
a man can do only what he can do
but if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day
if i had my life to live over i would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall
i would go to more dances
i would ride more merrygorounds
i would pick more daisies
i finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it
we cannot do everything at once but we can do something at once
always do one thing less than you think you can do
i come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability
and when youve done the best you can you cant do any better
so when i go to sleep i turn everything over to the lord and forget it
a days work is a days work neither more nor less and the man who does it needs a days sustenance a nights repose and due leisure whether he be painter or ploughman
sufficient to each day are the duties to be done and the trials to be endured
i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith
i look back on my life like a good days work it is done and i am satisfied with it
the moment we pass out of our habits we lose all sense of permanency and routine
manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others
if you have that awareness you have good manners no matter what fork you use
and hearts have been broken from harsh words spoken that sorrow can neer set right
that which is horrifying to you dont do to anybody else
it is too bad if you have to do everything upon reflection and cant do anything from early habit
most of life is routinedull and grubby but routine is the mountain that keeps a man going
if you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street
good habits which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life
without the aid of prejudice and custom i should not be able to find my way across the room
motivation is what gets you started
habit is what keeps you going
habits are safer than rules you dont have to watch them
and you dont have to keep them either they keep you
habit is not mere subjugation it is a tender tie when one remembers habit it seems to have been happiness
to learn new habits is everything for it is to reach the substance of life
life is but a tissue of habits
choose always the way that seems the best however rough it may be custom will soon render it easy and agreeable
quality is not an act
it is a habit
it is not in novelty but in habit that we find the greatest pleasure
habit is stronger than reason
character is simply habit long enough continued
nothing is more powerful than habit
if you do the same thing every day at the same time for the same length of time youll save yourself from many a sink
routine is a condition of survival
have a time and place for everything and do everything in its time and place and you will not only accomplish more but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying
anyone can carry his burden however hard until nightfall
anyone can do his work however hard for one day
anyone can live sweetly patiently lovingly purely till the sun goes down
and this is all life really means
come what may time and the hour runs through the roughest day
at any rate you can bear it for a quarter of an hour
the longest day is soon ended
the secret of my success is that i always managed to live to fly another day
the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains
a day is a miniature eternity
one day with life and heart is more than time enough to find a world
a day is a span of time no one is wealthy enough to waste
when a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour it seems like a minute
but let him sit on a hot stove for a minute and its longer than any hour
thats relativity
too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice
but for those who love time is not
the less one has to do the less time one finds to do it in
one yawns one procrastinates one can do it when one will and therefore one seldom does it at all whereas those who have a great deal of business must buckle to it and then they always find time enough to do it
time is nothing absolute its duration depends on the rate of thought and feeling
time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people
what then is time
if no one asks me i know what it is
if i wish to explain it to him who asks i do not know
time is the product of changing realities beings existences
time is the arbitrary division of eternity
time is a part of eternity and of the same piece with it
each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death
time is eternity begun
time is not a line but a series of nowpoints
you cant measure time in days the way you can money in dollars because each day is different
an hour of pain is as long as a day of pleasure
the value of life lies not in the length of days but in the use we make of them a man may live long yet live very little
reality is a staircase going neither up nor down we dont move today is today always is today
what runs through a person like water through a sieve
scrolls write on them what you want to be remembered for
every day is a messenger of god
a little space of time before time expires a little way of breath
time is an avid gambler who has no need to cheat to win every time
time is the only critic without ambition
time is the most valuable thing a man can spend
time is a storm in which we are all lost
time is the wisest counsellor of all
time is the moving image of eternity
time is the soul of this world
time is a sandpile we run our fingers in
time is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at and who steals what is most precious to men
time is the tyrant of the body
time is that in which all things pass away
time is a file that wears and makes no noise
time is what we want most but what we use worst
time is the king of men
time  is the life of the soul
time is the dressing room for eternity
time is an available instrument for reaching the eternal
time itself is an element
time is the devourer of all things
time is the subtle thief of youth
time is the rider that breaks youth
time is an eternal guest that banquets on our ideals and bodies
time is an illusionto orators
the surest poison is time
time is a great manager it arranges things well
time is a river without banks
time is the greatest and longestestablished spinner of all
his factory is a secret place his work noiseless and his hands are mutes
time is the stuff lifes made of
time is my estate to time im heir
time is change transformation evolution
time is a circus always packing up and moving away
time is a dressmaker specializing in alterations
time is the greatest innovator
time is a wealth of change but the clock in its parody makes it mere change and no wealth
time is but the stream i go afishing in
time is the silent neverresting thing  rolling rushing on swift silent like an allembracing oceantide on which we and all the universe swim
time is a flowing river
happy those who allow themselves to be carried unresisting with the current
they float through easy days
they live unquestioning in the moment
time is a very shadow that passeth away
time is the author of authors
time is a stream which glides smoothly on and is past before we know
time is a sort of river of passing events and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place and this too will be swept away
time is the sea in which men grow are born or die
time is the longest distance between two places
id like to introduce a man with a lot of charm talent and wit
unfortunately he couldnt be here tonight so instead


i do not stand on protocol
if you just call me excellency it will be okay
the numberone fear in life is public speaking and the numbertwo fear is death
this means that if you go to a funeral youre better off in the casket than giving the eulogy
at the end of a long introduction you omitted perhaps one thing  that in 1974 i had a hemorrhoidectomy
my father gave me these hints on speech making be sincere  be brief  be seated
a good speech like a womans skirt should be long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest
i have been asked to give my address in the remaining five minutes
that i can do
here it is 10 carlton gardens london england
i sort of feel like cindy crawfords new husband on their wedding night
i know whats expected of me
im just not sure ive got the ability to make it interesting
if any of you are related to our main guest let me know so i can speak slowly
as my mother used to say mimic a duck act calm and unruffled on the surface but paddle like crazy underneath
some people might say that i think too highly of you just because i worship the water you walk on
as spinoza or someone very much like him once said


an evening like this would be empty without some reference to politics so lets just think of this as empty
speeches are like steer horns  a point here a point there and a lot of bull in between
my job is to talk to you and your job is to listen
if you finish first please let me know
i have noticed that the people who are late are often so much jollier than the people who have to wait for them
i dont want to be patronizing


that means talking down
speaker i have only ten minutes and hardly know where to begin
voice in back begin at the ninth
after such an introduction i can hardly wait to hear what im going to say
i was chosen to speak due to my warm personality



look up warm and it means not so hot
a speech thats full of sparkling wit will keep its hearer grinning provided its end is close to its beginning
it usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech
id like to tell you some jokes now but youd only laugh
the recipe for a good speech includes some shortening
i was told to be accurate be brief and then be seated

so i promise i shall be brief as possible  no matter how long it takes me
thank you for the privilege of speaking to you in this magnificent auditorium
you know the meaning of the word auditorium dont you
it is derived from two latin words audio to hear and taurus the bull
i was chosen to speak today based on my senility
a toastmaster is a man who eats a meal he doesnt want so he can get up and tell a lot of stories he doesnt remember to people whove already heard them
im an idealist i dont know where im going but im on my way
we noticed a crasher at the bar  that shows what a real man he is  hes here to show hes not ticked for not being asked
response to clapping thank you for ovating
i often quote myself
it adds spice to my conversation
a bore is a man who spends so much time talking about himself that you cant talk about yourself
buffet a french word that means get up and get it yourself
wit is the salt of conversation not the food
good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person
on how to become a good speaker practice all the time
one of the best ways is to put a bunch of marbles in your mouth while you talk
slowly but surely you take away a marble
and then when youve lost all your marbles youre a public speaker
once you get people laughing theyre listening and you can tell them almost anything
goldie hawn is funny sexy beautiful talented intelligent warm and consistently sunny
other than that she doesnt impress me at all
when i told her we were going to roast her she said of course


they only crucify the innocent
a lot of you want me to hurry through the introduction
thats because youre so much older you dont want to waste a minute of your life
even more exasperating than the guy who thinks he knows it all is the one who really does
we will then hear from the founder of the mayo clinic


dr ted clinic
the first rotarian was the first man to call john the baptist jack
will the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands
all the rest of you if youll just rattle your jewelry
as one skeleton said to the other  if i had any guts id get the heck out of here
thanks for the nice introduction
next to my resume thats the closest ill ever come to perfection
we were worried that our main speaker wouldnt be able to make it tonight
but fortunately due to a hole in the prosecutions case


i thought id begin by reading a poem by shakespeare but then i thought why should i
he never reads any of mine
i hope you will excuse my being late
the person in this organization who gave me directions here has obviously heard me speak before
when i was preparing for this speech i asked my family for advice
one member replied theres a first time for everything so try to be funny and brief
most experts suggest that one should open with a joke
obviously theyve never heard me tell a joke
good evening ladies and gentlemen
im pleased to be with you
pause that concludes my prepared remarks
im moving down here


because some of you in the back might not be able to hear my talk


and that wouldnt be fair to those who can hear it
it has been discovered experimentally that you can draw laughter from an audience anywhere in the world of any class or race simply by walking on a stage and uttering the words i am a married man
this gathering is what i call intimate which really means where is everybody
do not choose to be wrong for the sake of being different
if you want people to think well of you do not speak well of yourself
new opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common
so many men so many opinions
three spaniards four opinions
we are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we dont care for
one should respect public opinion in so far as it is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny
public opinion a vulgar impertinent anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for anyone who is not content to be the average man
youve no idea what a poor opinion i have of myself  and how little i deserve it
predominant opinions are generally the opinions of the generation that is vanishing
to be positive to be mistaken at the top of ones voice
when i want your opinion ill give it to you
the sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions
it is always considered a piece of impertinence in england if a man of less than two or three thousand a year has any opinions at all upon important subjects
the pressure of public opinion is like the pressure of the atmosphere you cant see it  but all the same it is sixteen pounds to the square inch
the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
the world is not run by thought nor by imagination but by opinion
no and yes are words quickly said but they need a great amount of thought before you utter them
i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
it is not truth but opinion that can travel the world without a passport
there never were two opinions alike in all the world no more than two hours or two grains the most universal quality is diversity
a difference of opinion is what makes horse racing and missionaries
public opinion is a compound of folly weakness prejudice wrong feeling right feeling obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs
the foolish and the dead alone never change their opinions
all empty souls tend to extreme opinion
too often we


enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought
opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them
there are a great many opinions in this world and a good half of them are professed by people who have never been in trouble
it were not best that we should all think alike it is difference of opinion that makes horseraces
stiff in opinion always in the wrong
it is rare that the public sentiment decides immorally or unwisely and the individual who differs from it ought to distrust and examine well his own opinion
those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth
public opinion though often formed upon a wrong basis yet generally has a strong underlying sense of justice
opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them
the foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion
force and not opinion is the queen of the world but it it opinion that uses the force
public opinion is a compound of folly weakness prejudice wrong feeling right feeling obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs
the feeble tremble before opinion the foolish defy it the wise judge it the skillful direct it
i know where there is more wisdom than is found in napoleon voltaire or all the ministers present and to come  in public opinion
you create your opportunities by asking for them
a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds
look for opportunity
you cant wait for it to knock on the door
you might not be home
if you want to succeed in the world you must make your own opportunities
life is a narrative that you have a hand in writing
mediocre men wait for opportunity to come to them
strong able alert men go after opportunity
a filly who wants to run will always find a rider
life is what we make it always has been always will be
god forgives those who invent what they need
many things are lost for want of asking
you dont just luck into things  you build step by step whether its friendships or opportunities
every man is the architect of his own fortune
he that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner
there is no security on this earth
only opportunity
too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity they seem more afraid of life than of death
freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst
the opportunity is often lost by deliberating
i have always been waiting for something bettersometimes to see the best i had snatched from me
the sad truth is that opportunity doesnt knock twice
you can put things off until tomorrow but tomorrow may never come
where will you be a few years down the line
will it be everything you dreamed of
we seal our fate with the choices we take but dont give a second thought to the chances we take
you decide youll wait for your pitch
then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance
and then you think about your swing
and then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch
small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises
any ritual is an opportunity for transformation
ability is of little account without opportunity
our opportunities to do good are our talents
opportunity knocks at every mans door once
on some mens door it hammers till it breaks down the door and then it goes in and wakes him up if hes asleep and ever afterward it works for him as a night watchman
it is less important to redistribute wealth than it is to redistribute opportunity
you cant make souffle rise twice
a door that seems to stand open must be a mans size or it is not the door that providence means for him
next to knowing when to seize an opportunity the most important thing in life is to know when to forgo an advantage
the follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didnt commit when he had the opportunity
to see a shadow and think it is a treethat is a pity but to see a tree and to think it a shadow can be fatal
great opportunities come to all but many do not know they have met them
the only preparation to take advantage of them is simple fidelity to watch what each day brings
opportunities are everywhere
opportunities are usually disguised as hard work so most people dont recognize them
the world is all gates all opportunities strings of tension waiting to be struck
no great man ever complains of want of opportunity
great opportunities to help others seldom come but small ones come daily
men do with opportunities as children do at the seashore they fill their little hands with sand and then let the grains fall through one by one till all are gone
do not wait for ideal circumstances nor for the best opportunities they will never come
nothing is so often irretrievably missed as a daily opportunity
if a man looks sharply and attentively he shall see fortune for though she be blind yet she is not invisible
know thine opportunity
in great affairs we ought to apply ourselves less to creating chances than to profiting from those that are offered
opportunity is as scarce as oxygen men fairly breathe it and do not know it
opportunities do not come with their values stamped upon them
to face every opportunity of life thoughtfully and ask its meaning bravely and earnestly is the only way to meet supreme opportunities when they come whether openfaced or disguised
we are told that talent creates its own opportunities
but it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities but its own talents
how many opportunities present themselves to a man without his noticing them
luck affects everything
let your hook be always cast
in the stream where you least expect it there will be a fish
the opportunity that god sends does not wake up him who is asleep
present opportunities are neglected and attainable good is slighted by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages
opportunities multiply as they are seized they die when neglected
life is a long line of opportunities
it is often hard to distinguish between the hard knocks in life and those of opportunity
i think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it
everyone has bad breaks but everyone also has opportunities
the man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on
to improve the golden moment of opportunity and catch the good that is within our reach is the great art of life
the greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to ones opportunities and make the most of ones resources
when one door closes another opens
but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us
the opportunities for enjoyment in your life are limitless
if you feel you are not experiencing enough joy you have only yourself to blame
opportunities are often things you havent noticed the first time around
the successful man is one who had the chance and took it
vigilance in watching opportunity tact and daring in seizing upon opportunity force and persistence in crowding opportunity to its utmost possible achievementthese are the martial virtues which must command success
to avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall
opportunity knocks but once
i was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one
if fortune calls offer him a seat
what the student calls a tragedy the master calls a butterfly
opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work
times of stress and difficulty are seasons of opportunity when the seeds of progress are sown
we must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity
the best impromptu speeches are the ones written well in advance
opportunity can benefit no man who has not fitted himself to seize it and use it
opportunity woos the worthy shuns the unworthy
prepare yourself to grasp opportunity and opportunity is likely to come your way
it is not so fickle capricious and unreasoning as some complain
opportunity rarely knocks until you are ready
and few people have ever been really ready without receiving opportunitys call
the secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes
i always keep myself in a position of being a student
i think the young actor who really wants to act will find a way  to keep at it and seize every opportunity that comes along
if you want greater prosperity in your life start forming a vacuum to receive it
unless a man has trained himself for his chance the chance will only make him ridiculous
do not suppose opportunity will knock twice at your door
make hay while the sun shines
plough deep while sluggards sleep
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
the opportunity for doing mischief is found a hundred times a day and of doing good once in a year
in the midst of winter i finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer
one cloud is enough to eclipse all the sun
the progress of rivers to the ocean is not so rapid as that of man to error
when i look in the glass i see that every line in my face means pessimism but in spite of my face  that is my experience  i remain an optimist
an optimist is a guy that has never had much experience
an optimist is a fellow who believes whats going to be will be postponed
pessimist  one who when he has the choice of two evils chooses both
my pessimism goes to the point of suspecting the sincerity of the pessimists
a pessimist is one who has been compelled to live with an optimist
pessimism is only the name that men of weak nerves give to wisdom
when it is dark enough you can see the stars
there is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle
when things come to the worst they generally mend
the optimist claims we live in the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist fears this is true
still round the corner there may wait a new road or a secret gate
when fortune empties her chamberpot on your head smile and say we are going to have a summer shower
the world gets better every day  then worse again in the evening
a man he seems of cheerful yesterdays and confident tomorrows
there is a budding morrow in midnight
optimism a cheerful frame of mind that enables a tea kettle to sing though in hot water up to its nose
an optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity a pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity
to look up and not down to look forward and not back to look out and not in and to lend a hand
two men look out through the same bars one sees the mud and one the stars
keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow
oratory is the power to talk people out of their sober and natural opinions
glittering generalities
they are blazing ubiquities
i am not fond of uttering platitudes in stainedglass attitudes
the object of oratory is not truth but persuasion
what the orators want in depth they give you in length
it is much safer to obey than to rule
let all things be done decently and in order
there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere anytime
when liberty destroys order the hunger for order will destroy liberty
those who are fond of setting things to rights have no great objection to setting them wrong
to have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence
our laws make law impossible our liberties destroy all freedom our property is organized robbery our morality an impudent hypocrisy our wisdom is administered by inexperienced or malexperienced dupes our power wielded by cowards and weaklings and our honour false in all its points
i am an enemy of the existing order for good reasons
crude classifications and false generalizations are the curse of organized life
timing degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life
we put things in order  god does the rest
lay an iron bar east and west it is not magnetized
lay it north and south and it is
i must create a system or be enslaved by another mans
out of intense complexities intense simplicities emerge
there is no course of life so weak and sottish as that which is managed by order method and discipline
large organization is loose organization
nay it would be almost as true to say that organization is always disorganization
thats what learning is
you suddenly understand something you understood all your life but in a new way
have a place for everything and have everything in its place
set thine house in order
order is heavens first law
originality is the art of concealing your sources
utter originality is of course out of the question
we do not inherit this land from our ancestors we borrow it from our children
why cant somebody give us a list of things that everybody thinks and nobody says and another list of things that everybody says and nobody thinks
originality is nothing but judicious imitation
the most original writers borrowed one from another
the instruction we find in books is like fire
we fetch it from our neighbours kindle it at home communicate it to others and it becomes the property of all
originality does not consist in saying what no one has ever said before but in saying exactly what you think yourself
what a good thing adam had  when he said a good thing he knew nobody had said it before
all cases are unique and very similar to others
i invent nothing
i rediscover
there is nothing new under the sun
when people are free to do as they please they usually imitate each other
originality is deliberate and forced and partakes of the nature of a protest
all profoundly original work looks ugly at first
riding hard for glory
what is originality
undetected plagiarism
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion
as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew
we must disenthrall ourselves
you always admire what you really dont understand
what you cant get is just what suits you
the dream is real my friends
the failure to realize it is the only reality
the true exercise of freedom iscannily and wisely and with graceto move inside what space confinesand not seek to know what lies beyond and cannot be touched or tasted
death and taxes and childbirth
theres never any convenient time for any of them
no one is content with his own lot
let us accept truth even when it surprises us and alters our views
to have ideals is not the same as to have impracticable ideals
there has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present
every stage of life has its troubles and no man is content with his own age
we love in others what we lack ourselves and would be everything but what we are
there is less in this than meets the eye
when you dont have any money the problem is food
when you have money its sex
when you have both its health
if everything is simply jake then youre frightened of death
diogenes was asked what wine he liked best and he answered somebody elses
the apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest
nothing is so good as it seems beforehand
happiness is  usually attributed by adults to children and by children to adults
acorns were good till bread was found
none of us is ever satisfied with what we are
we always long for forbidden things k and desire what is denied us
mans heart is never satisfied the snake would swallow the elephant
we all envy other peoples luck
when every blessed thing you have is made of silver or of gold you long for simple pewter
id rather have written cheers than anything ive written
when a mans busy leisure strikes him as a wonderful pleasure and at leisure once is he
straightway he wants to be busy
to most of us the real life is the life we do not lead
happiness to a dog is what lies on the other side of the door
man would be otherwise
that is the essence of the specifically human
he who would be happy should stay at home
he who leaves his house in search of happiness pursues a shadow
it is not irritating to be where one is
it is only irritating to think one would like to be somewhere else
pioneers may be picturesque figures but they are often rather lonely ones
he that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another
we are under the spell always of what is distant from us
it is not in our nature to desire passionately what is near at hand
in all climates under all skies mans happiness is always somewhere else
in rome you long for the country
in the country you praise to the skies the distant town
he who would be happy should stay at home
life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed by the desire of changing his bed
one would prefer to suffer near the fire and another is certain he would get well if he were by the window
it is common to overlook what is near by keeping the eye fixed on something remote
there are three wants which can never be satisfied that of the rich who want something more that of the sick who want something different and that of the traveler who says anywhere but here
happiness grows at our firesides and is not to be picked in strangers gardens
men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places
the proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one
if solid happiness we prize within our breast this jewel lies and they are fools who roam the world has nothing to bestow from our own selves our bliss must flow and that dear hutour home
a child on a farm sees a plane fly overhead and dreams of a faraway place
a traveler on the plane sees the farmhouse and dreams of home
life has no smooth road for any of us and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend over steep ways to the stars fulfills itself
the only normal people are the ones you dont know very well
before we set our hearts too much upon anything let us examine how happy they are who already possess it
what makes us discontented with our condition is the absurdly exaggerated idea we have of the happiness of others
nobodys problem is ideal
nobody has things just as he would like them
everybody in the world ought to be sorry for everybody else
we all have our little private hell
we are convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes it possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself
men would be angels angels would be gods
none think the great unhappy but the great
if every mans internal care were written on his brow how many would our pity share who raise our envy now
misfortunes come to all men
you have no idea how big the other fellows troubles are
i have been very happy very rich very beautiful much adulated very famous and very unhappy
i feel successful when the writing goes well
this lasts five minutes
once when i was on the bestseller list i also felt successful
that lasted three minutes
great and small suffer the same mishaps
i thought i had reached a point in life where everything would be smooth
but it is not
it just gets more jagged and pitted and filled with turns that take you into the dark recesses of your mind
it never seems to get easy
if i were given a change of life id like to see how it would be to live as a mere sixfooter
i just want to be an ordinary girl
money is another pressure
im not complaining im just saying that theres a certain luxury in having no money
i spent ten years in new york not having it not worrying about it
suddenly you have it then you worry where is it going
am i doing the right thing with it
on the outside one is a star
but in reality one is completely alone doubting everything
to experience this loneliness of soul is the hardest thing in the world
there is no man in this world without some manner of tribulation or anguish though he be king or pope
the only incurable troubles of the rich are the troubles that money cant cure
there is no man in any rank who is always at liberty to act as he would incline in some quarter or other he is limited by circumstances
none of us can be free of conflict and woe
even the greatest men have had to accept disappointments as their daily bread

the art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them
renown is a source of toil and sorrow obscurity is a source of happiness
my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
if i had my life to live over i wish i could be a great pianist or something
there is no armour against fate death lays his icy hands on kings
pale death with impartial tread beats at the poor mans cottage door and at the palaces of kings
i want to be able to live without a crowded calendar
i want to be able to read a book without feeling guilty or go to a concert when i like
id like to be a truck driver
i think you could run your life that way
it wouldnt be such a bad way of doing it
it would offer a chance to be alone
there is as much confusion in the world of the gods as in ours
pray the gods do not envy your happiness
the suffering of the rich is among the sweetest pleasures of the poor
oh god dont envy me i have my own pains
success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed
i have known no man of genius who had not to pay in some affliction or defect either physical or spiritual for what the gods had given him
i have been very happy very rich very beautiful much adulated very famous and very unhappy
i feel successful when the writing goes well
this lasts five minutes
once when i was on the bestseller list i also felt successful
that lasted three minutes
men are all the same
they always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got
not all speed is movement
success is not greedy as people think but insignificant
thats why it satisfies nobody
oh i wish that god had not given me what i prayed for
it was not so good as i thought
beggars do not envy millionaires though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful
ambition having reached the summit longs to descend
what we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance
the superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room each believing himself in mortal peril from the other who he assumes to have perfect vision
wanting to change to improve a persons situation means offering him for difficulties in which he is practiced and experienced other difficulties that will find him perhaps even more bewildered
being considered beautiful at a young age sends confusing signals
you think people only like you because of your beauty
youth is not a question of years one is young or old from birth
when i was fourteen i was the oldest i ever was

ive been getting younger ever since
a childs world is fresh and new and beautiful full of wonder and excitement
it is our misfortune that for most of us that cleareyed vision that true instinct for what is beautiful and aweinspiring is dimmed and even lost before we reach adulthood
sure im for helping the elderly
im going to be old myself someday
youth is something very new twenty years ago no one mentioned it
a comfortable old age is the reward of a wellspent youth
instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world
we turn not older with years but newer every day
old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves
the middle years caught between children and parents free of neither the past stretches back too densely it is too thickly populated the future has not yet thinned out
it is not how old you are but how you are old
one of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that its such a nice change from being young
when you become 100 life changes completely
this is a youthoriented society and the joke is on them because youth is a disease from which we all recover
old age believe me is a good and pleasant thing
it is true you are gently shouldered off the stage but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator
i look forward to growing old and wise and audacious
it is so comical to hear oneself called old even at ninety i suppose
i enjoy my wrinkles and regard them as badges of distinctionive worked hard for them
timeour youthit never really goes does it
it is all held in our minds
even i dont wake up looking like cindy crawford
we all lose our looks eventually better develop your character and interest in life
the lovely thing about being forty is that you can appreciate twentyfiveyearold men more
the only thing that makes one place more attractive to me than another is the quantity of heart i find in it
a woman may develop wrinkles and cellulite lose her waistline her bustline her ability to bear a child even her sense of humor but none of that implies a loss of her sexuality her femininity
old age is like a plane flying through a storm
once you are aboard there is nothing you can do
in youth the days are short and the years are long
in old age the years are short and days long
how long can you be cute
being pretty on the inside means you dont hit your brother and you eat all your peasthats what my grandma taught me
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
when youre fifty you start thinking about things you havent thought about before
i used to think getting old was about vanitybut actually its about losing people you love
getting wrinkles is trivial
i am desperate and vulnerable

i am always terrified beauty can sometimes be so very troublesome
i hate myself on the screen
i want to die  my voice is either too high or too gravelly
i want to dive under the carpet
id love to be tall and willowy
im short
after a certain number of years our faces become our biographies
i dont like my voice
i dont like the way i look
i dont like the way i move
i dont like the way i act
i mean period
so you know i dont like myself
not always the fanciest cake thats there is the best to eat
no doctor i dont want to grow young again
i just want to keep on growing old
it is quite wrong to think of old age as a downward slope
on the contrary one climbs higher and higher with the advancing years and that too with surprising strides
i look forward to being older when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the i point
when youve got the personality you dont need the nudity
the only real elegance is in the mind if youve got that the rest really comes from it
beauty can get a woman what she wants love and money
but when beauty leaves you so can the things it brought
if youre considered a beauty its hard to be accepted doing anything but standing around
just because youre beautiful they think you cant act
ive got a lot more to prove
i intimidate men people look a lot but theres no line outside my door
people see you as an object not as a person and they project a set of expectations onto you
people who dont have it think beauty is a blessing but actually it sets you apart
i can count the number of dates ive had on one hand
i wish that guys would approach me but they dont
when you step on the first tee it doesnt matter what you look like

it doesnt help your 5iron if youre pretty
for years i stopped reading beauty magazines because i couldnt look at one without wanting to blow my brains out
how can those women look so good
each time i get off a plane in hollywood i dont think im pretty enough
frankly i like the fact that i no longer fit the young beauty typepeople take me more seriously now
you know how many stunning women told me they cant stand a goodlooking man
women feel secure with an ugly guy because a man in bad shape isnt gonna cheat
outstanding beauty like outstanding gifts of any kind tends to get in the way of normal emotional development and thus of that particular success in life which we call happiness
a full bosom is actually a millstone around a womans neck
breasts are not parts of a person but lures slung around her neck to be kneaded and twisted like magic putty or mumbled and mouthed like lolly ices
plain women know more about men than beautiful ones do
people are crying up the rich and variegated plumage of the peacock and he is himself blushing at the sight of his ugly feet
im walking insecurity
without all this makeup i look like a refugee when i get up in the morning
i generally look like one major bowwow
i mean arf
you start out happy that you have no hips or boobs
all of a sudden you get them and it feels sloppy
then just when you start liking them they start dropping
the problem with beauty is that its like being born rich and getting poorer
guys think that if a girl is pretty shes automatically going to say no
most of the guys ive gone out with ive had to make it completely obvious that id like them to ask me out
or ive had to ask them
i think if i werent so beautiful maybe id have more character
not many people ask me out
the striking point about our model family is not simply the competecompete consumeconsume style of life it urges us to follow
the striking point in the face of all the propaganda is how few americans actually live this way
instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men
it then appears that we are among the privileged
i murmured because i had no shoes until i met man who had no feet
comparison more than reality makes men happy or wretched
the man with a toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound
the povertystricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man
if you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself
i look at what i have not and think myself unhappy others look at what i have and think me happy
enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another
if we only wanted to be happy it would be easy but we want to be happier than other people which is almost always difficult since we think them happier than they are
i never admired anothers fortune so much that i became dissatisfied with my own
every horse thinks his own pack heaviest
comparisons of ones lot with others teaches us nothing and enfeebles the will
to think well of every other mans condition and to dislike our own is one of the misfortunes of human nature
other peoples eggs have two yolks
no story ever looks as bad as the story youve just bought no story ever looks as good as the story the other fellow just bought
if all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence every one must take an equal portion most people would be content to take their own and depart
money it turned out was exactly like sex you thought of nothing else if you didnt have it and thought of other things if you did
envy is an insult to oneself
jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies
envy has the ugliness of a trapped rat that has gnawed its own foot in its effort to escape
jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold in the heart
envy eats nothing but its own heart
jealousy is all the fun you think they had
jealousy would be far less torturous if we understood that love is a passion entirely unrelated to our merits
in jealousy there is more of selflove than love
jealousy is an inner consciousness of ones own inferiority
it is a mental cancer
jealousy that dragon which slays love under the pretense of keeping it alive
there is no greater glory than love nor any greater punishment than jealousy
as a moth gnaws a garment so doth envy consume a man
envy is the most stupid of vices for there is no single advantage to be gained from it
the jealous are troublesome to others but torment to themselves
envy and fear are the only passions to which no pleasure is attached
if malice or envy were tangible and had a shape it would be the shape of a boomerang
envy is a kind of praise
envy among other ingredients has a mixture of the love of justice in it
we are more angry at undeserved than at deserved good fortune
envy comes from peoples ignorance of or lack of belief in their own gifts
to cure jealousy is to see it for what it is a dissatisfaction with self
if envy were a fever all the world would be ill
jealousy is not a barometer by which the depth of love can be read
it merely records the degree of the lovers insecurity
the heaven of the envied is hell for the envious
you cant be envious and happy at the same time
the whole art of life is knowing the right time to say things
it is not until you become a mother that your judgment slowly turns to compassion and understanding
if we would build on a sure foundation in friendship we must love friends for their sake rather than for our own
friendship which is of its nature a delicate thing fastidious slow of growth is easily checked will hesitate demur recoil where love good old blustering love bowls ahead and blunders through every obstacle
it is all right to say exactly what you think if you have learned to think exactly
silence sweeter is than speech
when we get to wishing a great deal for ourselves whatever we get soon turns into mere limitation and exclusion
the opposite of talking isnt listening
the opposite of talking is waiting
listening is not merely not talking though even that is beyond most of our powers it means taking a vigorous human interest in what is being told us
why is it that people who cannot show feeling presume that that is a strength and not a weakness
true love grows by sacrifice and the more thoroughly the soul rejects natural satisfaction the stronger and more detached its tenderness becomes
the nice thing about teamwork is that you always have others on your side
if you wish to fear nothing consider that everything is to be feared
i am deliberate and afraid of nothing
i survived my childhood by birthing many separate identities to stand in for one another in times of great stress and fear
how does one kill fear
how do you shoot a specter through the heart slash off its spectral head take it by its spectral throat
the brave man is not he who feels no fear for that were stupid and irrational but he whose noble soul its fear subdues and barely dares the danger nature shrinks from
perhaps the most important thing we can undertake toward the reduction of fear is to make it easier for people to accept themselves to like themselves
when fear seizes change what you are doing
you are doing something wrong
grab the broom of anger and drive off the beast of fear
we will not be driven by fear  if we remember that we are not descended from fearful men
when we are afraid we ought not to occupy ourselves with endeavoring to prove that there is no danger but in strengthening ourselves to go on in spite of the danger
every time i start a picture
i feel the same fear the same selfdoubts


and i have only one source on which i can draw because it comes from within me
fear is met and destroyed with courage
a cheerful frame of mind reinforced by relaxation which in itself banishes fatigue is the medicine that puts all ghosts of fear on the run
to hell with pleasure thats haunted by fear
what i emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment
i steer my bark with hope in my heart leaving fear astern
why should a man fear since chance is all in all for him and he can clearly foreknow nothing
best to live lightly as one can unthinking
i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears
any device whatever by which one frees himself from fear is a natural good
joking about deathor anything else that oppresses usmakes it less frightening
humor acts to relieve fear
if you can keep your head when all about are losing theirs its just possible you havent grasped the situation
fear is a kind of bell or gong which rings the mind into quick life and avoidance upon the approach of danger
it is the souls signal for rallying
if you can keep your head when all about are losing theirs its just possible you havent grasped the situation
fear is an emotion indispensable for survival
fear is the single strongest motivating force in our lives

the more frightened you become the better your chances of achieving success
we only really face up to ourselves when we are afraid
if youre never scared or embarrassed or hurt it means you never take any chances
fear makes us feel our humanity
a cowards fear can make a coward valiant
fear drives you and makes you better
fear is an instructor of great sagacity and the herald of all revolutions
just as courage imperils life fear protects it
in order to feel anything you need strength
there are times when fear is good
it must keep its watchful place at the hearts controls
a danger foreseen is half avoided
a good scare is worth more to a man than good advice
fear is a fine spur
fear is a question what are you afraid of and why
just as the seed of health is an illness because illness contains information our fears are a treasure house of selfknowledge if we explore them
men who fear god face life fearlessly
men who do not fear god end up fearing everything
it is only the fear of god that can deliver us from the fear of men
being scared can keep a man from getting killed and often makes a better fighter of him
nerves provide me with energy
its when i dont have them when i feel at ease that i get worried
fear is an emotion indispensable for survival
fear gives sudden instincts of skill
i quit being afraid when my first venture failed and the sky didnt fall down
fear of losing is what makes competitors so great
show me a gracious loser and ill show you a permanent loser
fear is the father of courage and the mother of safety
fear is the needle that pierces us that it may carry a thread to bind us to heaven
fear is the thought of admitted inferiority

fear is a cloak which old men huddle about their love as if to keep it warm
fear is the tax that conscience pays to guilt

fear is the souls signal for rallying
fear is an instructor of great sagacity and the herald of all revolutions
fear is static that prevents me from hearing myself

fear is the main source of superstition and one of the main sources of cruelty
fear is a slinking cat i find beneath the lilacs of my mind
fear is the start of wisdom
fear is the lengthened shadow of ignorance
fear is the highest fence
fear is uncertainty
fear is sand in the machinery of life
fear is the dark room in which negatives are developed
nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear
i am not afraid

i was born to do this
i have a lot of things to prove to myself
one is that i can live my life fearlessly
fear betrays unworthy souls
fear is not a good teacher
the lessons of fear are quickly forgotten
fear could never make a virtue
considering how dangerous everything is nothing is really very frightening
were the diver to think on the jaws of the shark he would never lay hands on the precious pearl
every problem in your life goes away in front of a bull because this problem the bull is bigger than all other problems
of course i have fear but it is fear that i will fail the responsibility i have taken on in front of all those peoplenot fear of the bull
fear is stronger than arms
fear is sharpsighted and can see things under ground and much more in the skies
it is better to have a right destroyed than to abandon it because of fear
better a fearful end than fear without end
a great philosophy is not a philosophy without reproach it is philosophy without fear
there is a time to take counsel of your fears and there is a time to never listen to any fear
i a stranger and afraid in a world i never made
while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness the weight of that silence will choke us
all we are asked to bear we can bear
that is a law of the spiritual life
the only hindrance to the working of this law as of all benign laws is fear
but is a fence over which few leap
there are always two voices sounding in our earsthe voice of fear and the voice of confidence
one is the clamor of the senses the other is the whispering of the higher self
fear nothing for every renewed effort raises all former failures into lessons all sins into experience
better hazard once than always be in fear
pitching is the art of instilling fear by making a man flinch
fear has a large shadow but he himself is small
stripped of all their masquerades the fears of men are quite identical the fear of loneliness rejection inferiority unmanageable anger illness and death
what is there to be afraid of

so what
i failed at a lot of things
my first record was horrible
there is no hope unmingled with fear and no fear unmingled with hope
leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear and no concept of the odds against them
they make the impossible happen
those who love to be feared fear to be loved
some fear them but they fear everyone
keep your fears to yourself but share your courage with others
there is a courageous wisdom there is also a false reptile prudence the result not of caution but of fear
the man who fears nothing is as powerful as he who is feared by everybody
to conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom
who is more foolish the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light
the one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fearfear of the unknown the complex the inexplicable
what he wants beyond everything else is safety

the best way to bring up some children is short

party honesty is party expediency
now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party
what our age lacks is not reflection but passion
it is with our passions as it is with fire and water  they are good servants but bad masters
the happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions
the ruling passion be it what it will the ruling passion conquers reason still
there is no passion like that of a functionary for his function
an intense feeling carries with it its own universe magnificent or wretched as the case may be
he disliked emotion not because he felt lightly but because he felt deeply
people dont ask for facts in making up their minds
they would rather have one good soulsatisfying emotion than a dozen facts
if we resist our passions it is more due to their weakness than to our strength
a sentimentalist is simply one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it
is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance
the world is a comedy to those who think a tragedy to those who feel
follow your heart and you perish
the only people for me are the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved


the ones who never yawn and say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars

seeings believing but feelings the truth

in my sex fantasy nobody ever loves me for my mind
the human race has been set up
someone somewhere is playing a practical joke on us
apparently women need to feel loved to have sex
men need to have sex to feel loved
how do we ever get started
you call it madness but i call it love
passion makes the world go round
love just makes it a safer place
love is an exploding cigar we willingly smoke
love is not altogether a delirium yet it has many points in common therewith
love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired
a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous
soul meets soul on lovers lips
i have found men who didnt know how to kiss
ive always found time to teach them
people who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy
to be in love is merely to be in a state of perpetual anesthesia to mistake an ordinary young man for a greek god or an ordinary young woman for a goddess
many a man in love with a dimple makes a mistake of marrying the whole girl
she walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all thats best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes
love teaches even asses to dance
love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species
anyone can be passionate but it takes real lovers to be silly

the big difference between sex for money and sex for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less
a lover without indiscretion is no lover at all
happy are those lovers who when their senses require rest can fall back upon the intellectual enjoyments afforded by the mind
sweet sleep then comes and lasts until the body has recovered its general harmony
on awaking the senses are again active and always ready to resume their action
if we seek the pleasures of love passion should be occasional and common sense continual
love  a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain causes eyes to sparkle cheeks to glow blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker
love aint nothing but sex misspelled
women need a reason to have sex
men just need a place
sex alleviates tension
love causes it
i have loved to the point of madness that which is called madness that which to me is the only sensible way to love
my wife is a sex object   every time i ask for sex she objects
sex is a conversation carried out by other means
if you get on well out of bed half the problems of bed are solved
i prefer love over sex
i know nothing about sex because i was always married
passion is universal humanity
without it religion history romance and art would be useless
knowledge of mankind is a knowledge of their passions
passions unguided are for the most part mere madness
take heed lest passion sway thy judgment to do aught which else free will would not admit
the ruling passion be it what it will the ruling passion conquers reason still
give me that man that is not passions slave
the present contains nothing more than the past and what is found in the effect was already in the cause
gone  glimmering through the dream of things that were
0 god
put back thy universe and give me yesterday
weep no more lady weep no more thy sorrow is in vain for violets plucked the sweetest showers will neer make grow again
1 tell you the past is a bucket of ashes
those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
the best prophet of the future is the past
patience and passage of time do more than strength and fury
patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruit
patience that blending of moral courage with physical timidity
the slow rhythm of waiting
what cant be cured must be endured
have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself
do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying them  every day begin the task anew
patience makes a woman beautiful in middle age
life on the farm is a school of patience you cant hurry the crops or make an ox in two days
there is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it
patience has its limits
take it too far and its cowardice
with time and patience the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown
people in a hurry cannot think cannot grow nor can they decay
they are preserved in a state of perpetual puerility
never cut what you can untie
i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
the more haste the less speed
hasten slowly
there are no short cuts to heaven only the ordinary way of ordinary things
never think that gods delays are gods denials
hold on hold fast hold out
patience is genius
a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
adopt the pace of nature her secret is patience
he that can have patience can have what he will
by time and toil we sever what strength and rage could never
all things come round to him who will but wait
and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of

what wound did ever heal but by degrees
patience is the art of hoping
ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow
i have never understood why ones affections must be confined as once with women to a single country
one of the great attractions of patriotism  it fulfills our worst wishes
in the person of our nation we are able vicariously to bully and cheat
bully and cheat whats more with a feeling that we are profoundly virtuous
patriotism is not short frenzied outbursts of emotion but the tranquil and steady dedicaton of a lifetime
true patriotism hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else
a nation is a body of people who have done great things together
each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong which course is patriotic and which isnt
you cannot shirk this and be a man
the french have a passion for revolution but an abhorrence of change
god made the ocean but the dutch made holland
the creator made italy with designs by michelangelo
men may be linked in friendship
nations are linked only by interests
what makes a nation great is not primarily its great men but the stature of its innumerable mediocre ones
there is ontario patriotism quebec patriotism or western patriotism each based on the hope that it may swallow up the others but there is no canadian patriotism and we can have no canadian nation when we have no canadian patriotism
im troubled
im dissatisfied
im irish
the mind supplies the idea of a nation but what gives this idea its sentimental force is a community of dreams
my favourite example of expatriotism is james joyce who left ireland at nineteen and never came back
but he spent the rest of his life writing about ireland from the perspective of living in paris
a nation is a body of people who have done great things together in the past and hope to do great things together in the future
the swiss are not a people so much as a neat clean quite solvent business
ireland is a fatal disease fatal to englishmen and doubly fatal to irishmen
swim or sink live or die survive or perish with my country was my unalterable determination
our country
in her intercourse with foreign nations may she always be in the right but our country right or wrong

1 realize that patriotism is not enough
i must have no hatred toward any one
den i wish i was in dixie hooray
hooray
in dixie land ill take my stand to lib and die in dixie
i only regret that i have but one life to lose for my country
i am not a virginian but an american
patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
breathes there the man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said this is my own my native land
the world is my country all mankind are my brethren and to do good is my religion
millions for defense but not one cent for tribute
the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit
the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
it takes time love and support to find peace with the restless one
the only peace the only security is in fulfillment
peace of mind is that mental condition in which you have accepted the worst
in truth to attain to interior peace one must be willing to pass through the contrary to peace
when at night you cannot sleep talk to the shepherd and stop counting sheep
when we are unable to find tranquility within ourselves it is useless to seek it elsewhere
if you do not find peace in yourself you will never find it anywhere else
if there is to be any peace it will come through being not having
nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul
peace does not dwell in outward things but within the soul we may preserve it in the midst of the bitterest pain if our will remains firm and submissive
peace in this life springs from acquiescence to not in an exemption from suffering
nothing can bring you peace but yourself
in a world filled with causes for worry and anxiety  we need the peace of god standing guard over our hearts and minds
peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of god no matter what the conflict
there may be those on earth who dress better or eat better but those who enjoy the peace of god sleep better
this is a sane wholesome practical working faith that it is a mans business to do the will of god second that god himself takes on the care of that man and third that therefore that man ought never to be afraid of anything
when we believe that god is father we also believe that such a fathers hand will never cause his child a needless tear
we may not understand life any better but we will not resent life any longer
the peace is won by accompanying god into the battle
i do not want the peace which passeth understanding i want the understanding which bringeth peace
it takes more distress and poison to kill someone who has peace of mind and loves life
she could not separate success from peace of mind
the two must go together
there is no such thing as inner peace there is only nervousness and death
when fire and water are at war it is the fire that loses
before the war and especially before the boer war it was summer all the year round
one sword keeps another in the sheath
peace is a virtual mute sustained victory of potential powers against probable greeds
peace is not an absence of war it is a virtue a state of mind a disposition for benevolence confidence justice
there are no makers of peace because the making of peace is at least as costly as the making of war  at least as exigent
once you hear the details of victory it is hard to distinguish it from a defeat
the peace of the man who has foresworn the use of the bullet seems to me not quite peace but a canting impotence
where they make a desert they call it peace
that they may have a little peace even the best dogs are compelled to snarl occasionally
peace in international affairs a period of cheating between two periods of fighting
they sicken of the calm who know the storm
time spent with cats is never wasted
there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats
you cant look at a sleeping cat and be tense
it is impossible to keep a straight face in the presence of one or more kittens
dogs come when theyre called cats take a message and get back to you
cats are smarter than dogs
you cant get eight cats to pull a sled through snow
cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want
cats are angels with fur
whoever said you cant buy happiness forgot about little puppies
there is no psychiatrist in the world like a puppy licking your face
know thyself
dont accept your dogs admiration as conclusive evidence that you are wonderful
dogs are not our whole life but they make our lives whole
living with a dog is one way to retain something of a childs spirit
a dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself
the greatest pleasure of a dog is that you may make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you but he will make a fool of himself too
the dog is the god of frolic
i wonder if other dogs think poodles are members of a weird religious cult
i have always thought of a dog lover as a dog that was in love with another dog
a dog wags its tail with its heart
dogs laugh but they laugh with their tails
money will buy a pretty good dog but it wont buy the wag of his tail
no matter how little money and how few possessions you own having a dog makes you rich
peace is the first thing the angels sang
peace is the mark of the sons of god
peace is the nurse of love
peace is the mother of unity
peace is the rest of blessed souls
peace is the dwelling place of eternity
peace is a daily a weekly a monthly process gradually changing opinions slowly eroding old barriers quietly building new structures
and however undramatic the pursuit of peace the pursuit must go on
choose to experience peace rather than conflict
you dont have to have fought in a war to love peace
war is an invention of the human mind
the human mind can invent peace
i think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of their way and let them have it
if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other
until he extends his circle of compassion to all living things man will not find peace
it isnt enough to talk about peace one must believe in it
and it isnt enough to believe in it one must work at it
before its too late and time is running out let us turn from trust in the chain reactions of exploding atoms to faith of the chain reaction of gods love
love  love of god and fellow men
that is gods formula for peace
the more we sweat in peace the less we bleed in war
it is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace
when we understand the other fellows viewpoint and he understands ours then we can sit down and work out our differences
it takes two to make peace
we merely want to live in peace with all the world to trade with them to commune with them to learn from their culture as they may learn from ours so that the products of our toil may be used for our schools and our roads and our churches and not for guns and planes and tanks and ships of war
the place to improve the world is first in ones own heart and head and hands
if we have not peace within ourselves it is in vain to seek it from outward sources
the only way to bring peace to the earth is to learn to make our own life peaceful
peace like charity begins at home
may you have warmth in your igloo oil in your lamp and peace in your heart
positive thoughts joy happiness fulfillment achievement worthiness have positive results enthusiasm calm wellbeing ease energy love
negative thoughts judgment unworthiness mistrust resentment fear produce negative results tension anxiety alienation anger fatigue
could we change our attitude we should not only see life differently but life itself would come to be different
life would undergo a change of appearance because we ourselves had undergone a change in attitude
life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it
our thoughts and imaginations are the only real limits to our possibilities
it is the mind that maketh good of ill that maketh wretch or happy rich or poor
most of us can as we choose make of this world either a palace or a prison
we are each gifted in a unique and important way
it is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light
before a painter puts a brush to his canvas he sees his picture mentally

if you think of yourself in terms of a painting what do you see
is the picture one you think worth painting



you create yourself in the image you hold in your mind
we cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange medley of life
but we can decide what happens in us  how we take it what we do with it  and that is what really counts in the end
get into the habit of looking for the silver lining of the cloud and when you have found it continue to look at it rather than at the leaden gray in the middle
it will help you over many hard places
keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow
there is very little difference in people but that little difference makes a big difference
the little difference is attitude
the big difference is whether it is positive or negative
it is not the situation
it is your reaction to the situation
there are two big forces at work external and internal
we have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes earthquakes floods disasters illness and pain
what really matters is the internal force
how do i respond to those disasters
over that i have complete control
if you will call your troubles experiences and remember that every experience develops some latent force within you you will grow vigorous and happy however adverse your circumstances may seem to be
diseases can be our spiritual flat tires  disruptions in our lives that seem to be disasters at the time but end by redirecting our lives in a meaningful way
out of difficulties grow miracles
great emergencies and crises show us how much greater our vital resources are than we had supposed
in the depth of winter i finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer
god gave us our memories so that we might have roses in december
im not afraid of storms for im learning how to sail my ship
help us to be the always hopeful gardeners of the spirit who know that without darkness nothing comes to birth as without light nothing flowers
the quickest way to change your attitude toward pain is to accept the fact that everything that happens to us has been designed for our spiritual growth
when somebody is angry with us we draw a halo around his or her head in our minds
does the person stop being angry then
well we dont know
we know though that when we draw a halo around a person suddenly the person starts to look like an angel to us
picture yourself placing your problem inside a pale yellow balloon letting it go watching it drift until it is a tiny pastel dot in the sky
whenever something good happens write it down
buy a special notebook


and use it to list all the good in your life
it doesnt hurt to be optimistic
you can always cry later
the average pencil is seven inches long with just a halfinch eraser  in case you thought optimism was dead
pessimism never won any battle
stop the mindless wishing that things would be different
rather than wasting time and emotional and spiritual energy in explaining why we dont have what we want we can start to pursue other ways to get it
man is so made that whenever anything fires his soul impossibilities vanish
deep within man dwell those slumbering powers powers that would astonish him that he never dreamed of possessing forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action
within you right now is the power to do things you never dreamed possible
this power becomes available to you just as soon as you can change your beliefs
exhilaration of life can be found only with an upward look
this is an exciting world
it is crampacked with opportunity
great moments wait around every corner
enthusiasm is the greatest asset in the world
it beats money and power and influence
nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared to believe that something inside of them was superior to circumstance
it is the ultimate wisdom of the mountains that we are never so much human as when we are striving for what is beyond our grasp and that there is no battle worth the winning save that against our own ignorance and fear
i keep the telephone of my mind open to peace harmony health love and abundance
then whenever doubt anxiety or fear try to call me they keep getting a busy signal and soon theyll forget my number
you can do anything you wish to do have anything you wish to have be anything you wish to be
people become really quite remarkable when they start thinking that they can do things
when they believe in themselves they have the first secret of success
what lies behind us and what lies before us are small matter compared to what lies within us
no matter what level of your ability you have more potential than you can ever develop in a lifetime
everyone has got it in him if he will only make up his mind and stick at it
none of us is born with a stopvalve on his powers or with a set limit to his capacities
there is no limit possible to the expansion of each one of us
everyone has inside of him a piece of good news
the good news is that you dont know how great you can bel how much you can love
what you can accomplish
and what your potential is i
the power which resides in man is new in nature and none but he knows what that is which he can do nor does he until he has tried
ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
trust yourself
you know more than you think you do
if we did all the things we are capable of doing we would literally astound ourselves
each of us makes his own weather determines the color of the skies in the emotional universe which he inhabits
every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man
every thing we see today made by past generations was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman
be brave enough to live creatively
the creative is the place where no one else has ever been
you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition
you cannot get there by bus only by hard work risking and by not quite knowing what you are doing
what you will discover will be wonderful yourself
be not afraid of life
believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact
your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life
i am not discouraged because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward
what is defeat
nothing but education nothing but the first step toward something better
to every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage
look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time
then your time on earth will be filled with glory
one for whom the pebble has value must be surrounded by treasures wherever he goes
were all only fragile threads but what a tapestry we make
today lets give thanks for life
for life itself
for simply being born
i prefer the most unfair peace to the most righteous war
peace rules the day where reason rules the mind
even peace may be purchased at too high a price
peace be with you

it is no use blaming the menwe made them what they areand now it is up to us to try and make ourselvesthe makers of mena little more responsible
lead me not into temptation i can find the way myself
believe there is a great power silently working all things for good behave yourself and never mind the rest
i made the decision
im accountable
what we prepare for is what we shall get
we make our own criminals and their crimes are congruent with the national culture we all share
it has been said that a people get the kind of political leadership they deserve
i think they also get the kinds of crime and criminals they themselves bring into being
if one asks for success and prepares for failure he will get the situation he has prepared for
we are accountable only to ourselves for what happens to us in our lives
i attribute my success to this i never gave or took an excuse
the world has a way of giving what is demanded of it
if you are frightened and look for failure and poverty you will get them no matter how hard you may try to succeed
lack of faith in yourself in what life will do for you cuts you off from the good things of the world
expect victory and you make victory
nowhere is this truer than in business life where bravery and faith bring both material and spiritual rewards
carry on carry on for the men and boys are gone but the furrow shant lie fallow while the women carry on
the willingness to accept responsibility for ones own life is the source from which selfrespect springs

a voice is a human gift it should be cherished and used to utter as fully human speech as possible
powerlessness and silence go together
persistent prophecy is a familiar way of assuring the event
the words i am  are potent words be careful what you hitch them to
the thing youre claiming has a way of reaching back and claiming you
a word after a word after a word is power
a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill
if you keep saying things are going to be bad you have a good chance of being a prophet
our lives preserved
how it was and how it will be
passing it along in the relay
that is what i work to do to produce stories that save our lives
when people asked i used to tell them how sick i was

finally i started saying im getting better
it took a while but then i started to feel better too
journal writing is a voyage to the interior
to know how to say what others only know how to think is what makes men poets or sages and to dare to say what others only dare to think makes men martyrs or reformersor both
my voice is still the same and this makes me beside myself with joy
oh mon dieu when i think what i might be able to do with it
men will get no more out of life than they put into it
he who sows courtesy reaps friendship and he who plants kindness gathers love
who soweth good seed shall surely reap the year grows rich as it groweth old and lifes latest sands are its sands of gold
whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
there is a very real relationship both quantitatively and qualitatively between what you contribute and what you get out of this world

he who has not faith in others shall find no faith in them
any man will usually get from other men just what he is expecting of them
if he is looking for friendship he will likely receive it
if his attitude is that of indifference it will beget indifference
and if a man is looking for a fight he will in all likelihood be accommodated in that

he who fears he shall suffer already suffers what he fears
fear to let fall a drop and you spill a lot
a person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself
he makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it
to be ambitious for wealth and yet always expecting to be poor to be always doubting your ability to get what you long for is like trying to reach east by travelling west
there is no philosophy which will help a man to succeed when he is always doubting his ability to do so and thus attracting failure
no matter how hard you work for success if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure it will kill your efforts neutralize your endeavors and make success impossible
he who fears being conquered is sure of defeat
dangers by being despised grow great
if one asks for success and prepares for failure he will get the situation he has prepared for
doubt breeds doubt
doubt indulged soon becomes doubt realized
fear breeds fear
the thing we fear we bring to pass
those who foresee the future and recognize it as tragic are often seized by a madness which forces them to commit the very acts which makes it certain that what they dread shall happen
there are certain people who so ardently and passionately desire a thing that from dread of losing it they leave nothing undone to make them lose it
a great manager has a knack for making ballplayers think they are better than they think they are
he forces you to have a good opinion of yourself
he lets you know he believes in you
he makes you get more out of yourself
and once you learn how good you really are you never settle for playing anything less than your very best
the only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him

it is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him
men have a trick of coming up to what is expected of them good or bad

where much is expected from an individual he may rise to the level of events and make the dream come true
people have a way of becoming what you encourage them to benot what you nag them to be

we must laugh before we are happy for fear of dying without having laughed at all

love me love my dog
its just the most amazing thing to love a dog isnt it
it makes our relationships with people seem as boring as a bowl of oatmeal
the better i get to know men the more i find myself loving dogs
love for a dog during childhood is one of the deepest and purest emotions we are ever likely to have and it remains with us for the rest of our lives
for some people their first experience with love is with a dog
the fact that the dog returns the love so fiercely so openly so unambivalently is for many children a unique and lasting experience
dogs love their friends and bite their enemies quite unlike people who are incapable of pure love and always have to mix love and hate in their


relations

praise to the undeserving is severe satire
its pleasant to hear these nice words while im still alive
id rather have the taffy than the epitaphy
commendation n the tribute that we pay to achievements that resemble but do not equal our own
applause is the spur of noble minds the end and aim of weak ones

he who gladly does without the praise of the crowd will not miss the opportunity of becoming his own fan

we treat him like a pasha or a sultan who is capable of being exasperated and appeased
the fewer the words the better the prayer
in prayer we call ourselves worms of the dust but it is only on a sort of tacit understanding that the remark shall not be taken at par
give us grace and strength to preserve
give us courage and gaiety and the quiet mind
spare to us our friends and soften to us our enemies
give us the strength to encounter that which is to come that we may be brave in peril constant in tribulation temperate in wrath and in all changes of fortune and down to the gates of death loyal and loving to one another

only by so doing can we expect to know him and as we come to know him better we shall spend more time in his presence and find that presence a constant and everincreasing delight
prayer honors god acknowledges his being exalts his power adores his providence secures his aid
the whole meaning of prayer is that we may know god

if we are willing to spend hours on end to learn to play the piano operate a computer or fly an airplane it is sheer nonsense for us to imagine that we can learn the high art of getting guidance through communion with the lord without being willing to set aside time for it
the great thing in prayer is to feel that we are putting our supplications into the bosom of omnipotent love
all the prayers in the scripture you will find to be reasoning with god not a multitude of words heaped together
scream at god if thats the only thing that will get results
you need not cry very loud he is nearer to us than we think
rejoice always pray constantly and in all circumstances give thanks
god tells us to burden him with whatever burdens us
do i want to pray or only to think about my human problems
do i want to pray or simply kneel there contemplating my sorrow
do i want to direct my prayer toward god or let it direct itself towards me
o thou by whom we come to god the life the truth the way the path of prayer thyself hast trod lord teach us how to pray
dealing in generalities is the death of prayer
dont try to reach god with your understanding that is impossible
reach him in love that is possible
the right way to pray then is any way that allows us to communicate with god
grant us grace almighty father so to pray as to deserve to be heard
he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast
he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all
confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
he that will learn to pray let him to sea
incense is prayer that drives no bargain
child learn from incense how best to pray
when we go to our meeting with god we should go like a patient to his doctor first to be thoroughly examined and afterwards to be treated for our ailment
then something will happen when you pray
natural ability and educational advantages do not figure as factors in this matter of prayer but a capacity for faith the power of a thorough consecration the ability of selflittleness an absolute losing of ones self in gods glory and an ever present and insatiable yearning and seeking after all the fullness of god
we have to pray with our eyes on god not on the difficulties
if our petitions are in accordance with his will and if we seek his glory in the asking the answers will come in ways that will astonish us and fill our hearts with songs of thanksgiving
pray if thou canst with hope but ever pray though hope be weak or sick with long delay pray in the darkness if there be no light and if for any wish thou dare not pray then pray to god to cast that wish away
prayer can assume very different forms from quiet blessed contemplation of god in which eye meets eye in restful meditation to deep sighs or sudden exclamations of wonder joy gratitude or adoration
to pray is nothing more involved than to open the door giving jesus access to our needs and permitting him to exercise his own power in dealing with them
he prays best who does not know that he is praying
when you cannot pray as you would pray as you can
if you cant pray as you want to pray as you can
god knows what you mean
pray till you pray
a day without prayer is a boast against god
prayer should be the key of the day and the lock of the night
i care not what black spiritual crisis we may come through or what delightful spiritual canaan we may enter no blessing of the christian life becomes continually possessed unless we are men and women of regular daily unhurried secret lingerings in prayer
in the morning prayer is the key that opens to us the treasures of gods mercies and blessings in the evening it is the key that shuts us up under his protection and safeguard
prayer is a kind of calling home every day
and there can come to you a serenity a feeling of athomeness in gods universe a peace that the world can neither give nor disturb a fresh courage a new insight a holy boldness that youll never never get any other way
o god if in the day of battle i forget thee do not thou forget me
seven days without prayer makes one weak
lord you know how busy i must be this day
if i forget you do not you forget me
we read of preaching the word out of season but we do not read of praying out of season for that is never out of season
let prayer be the key of the morning and the bolt at night
evening and morning and at noon will i pray
prayer should be the means by which i at all times receive all that i need and for this reason be my daily refuge my daily consolation my daily joy my source of rich and inexhaustible joy in life
as impossible as it is for us to take a breath in the morning large enough to last us until noon so impossible is it to pray in the morning in such a way as to last us until noon
let your prayers ascend to him constantly audibly or silently as circumstances throughout the day permit
to god your every want in instant prayer display pray always pray and never faint pray without ceasing pray
constant prayer quickly straightens out our thoughts
teach us to pray often that we may pray oftener
abiding fully means praying much
pray always pray beneath sins heaviest load prayer claims the blood from jesus side that flowed
pray always pray though weary faint and lone prayer nestles by the fathers sheltering throne
when the knees are not often bent the feet soon slide
the more praying there is in the world the better the world will be the mightier the forces against evil everywhere
those who always pray are necessary to those who never pray
tomorrow i plan to work work from early until late
in fact i have so much to do that i shall spend the first three hours in prayer
begin to realize more and more that prayer is the most important thing you do
you can use your time to no better advantage than to pray whenever you have an opportunity to do so either alone or with others while at work while at rest or while walking down the street
anywhere
it is impossible to conduct your life as a disciple without definite times of secret prayer
sometimes we think we are too busy to pray
that is a great mistake for praying is a saving of time
prayer time must be kept up as duly as mealtime
the minds of people are so cluttered up with everyday living these days that they dont or wont take time out for a little prayerfor mental cleansing just as they take a bath for physical outer cleansing
both are necessary
the christian will find his parentheses for prayer even in the busiest hours of life
time spent in prayer is never wasted
no time is so well spent in every day as that which we spend upon our knees
other duties become pressing and absorbing and crowd our prayer
choked to death would be the coroners verdict in many cases of dead praying if an inquest could be secured on this dire spiritual calamity
when it becomes clear to us that prayer is a part of our daily program of work it will also become clear to us that we must arrange our daily program in such a way that there is time also for this work just as we set aside time for other necessary things such as eating and dressing
i have to hurry all day to get time to pray
while others still slept he went away to pray and to renew his strength in communion with his father
he had need of this otherwise he would not have been ready for the new day
the holy work of delivering souls demands constant renewal through fellowship with god
and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed
get into the habit of dealing with god about everything
unless in the first waking moment of the day you learn to fling the door wide back and let god in you will work on a wrong level all day but swing the door wide open and pray to your father in secret and every public thing will be stamped with the presence of god
it is by no haphazard chance that in every age men have risen early to pray
the first thing that marks decline in spiritual life is our relationship to the early morning
the entire day receives order and discipline when it acquires unity
this unity must be sought and found in morning prayer
the morning prayer determines the day
cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning
in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee
if you have ever prayed in the dawn you will ask yourself why you were so foolish as not to do it always it is difficult to get into communion with god in the midst of the hurlyburly of the day
i feel it is far better to begin with god to see his face first to get my soul near him before it is near another
in general it is best to have at least one hour alone with god before engaging in anything else
lord if any have to die this day let it be me for i am ready
temptations which accompany the working day will be conquered on the basis of the morning breakthrough to god
decisions demanded by work become easier and simpler where they are made not in the fear of men but only in the sight of god
he wants to give us today the power which we need for our work
the man who says his prayers in the evening is a captain posting his sentries
after that he can sleep
when at night you cannot sleep talk to the shepherd and stop counting sheep
i did this night promise my wife never to go to bed without calling upon god upon my knees in prayer
i have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go
my own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for the day
there are no atheists on turbulent airplanes
ordinarily when a man in difficulty turns to prayer he has already tried every other means of escape
when life knocks you to your knees and it will why get up
if it knocks you to your knees again as it will well isnt that the best position from which to pray
now i am past all comforts here but prayer
prayer begins where human capacity ends
oh god if i were sure i were to die tonight i would repent at once
it is the commonest prayer in all languages
if you are swept off your feet its time to get on your knees
when i am weak then am i strong
to pray is to open the door unto jesus and admit him into your distress
your helplessness is the very thing which opens wide the door unto him and gives him access to all your needs
my helpless friend your helplessness is the most powerful plea which rises up to the tender fatherheart of god
you think that everything is closed to you because you cannot pray
my friend your helplessness is the very essence of prayer
listen my friend
your helplessness is your best prayer
it calls from your heart to the heart of god with greater effect than all your uttered pleas
he hears it from the very moment that you are seized with helplessness and he becomes actively engaged at once in hearing and answering the prayer of your helplessness
helplessness is unquestionably the first and the surest indication of a praying heart

prayer and helplessness are inseparable
only he who is helpless can truly pray
when we pray for the spirits help  we will simply fall down at the lords feet in our weakness
there we will find the victory and power that comes from his love
the more helpless you are the better you are fitted to pray and the more answers to prayer you will experience
being in an agony he prayed more earnestly
when a man is at his wits end it is not a cowardly thing to pray it is the only way he can get in touch with reality
when my soul fainted within me  my prayer came in unto thee
he will regard the prayer of the destitute
my strength is made perfect in weakness
god listens to our weeping when the occasion itself is beyond our knowledge but still within his love and power
trouble and prayer are closely related



trouble often drives men to god in prayer while prayer is but the voice of men in trouble
trouble and perplexity drive me to prayer and prayer drives away perplexity and trouble
an agnostic found himself in trouble and a friend suggested he pray
how can i pray when i do not know whether or not there is a god
he asked
if you are lost in the forest his friend replied you do not wait until you find someone before shouting for help
many people pray as if god were a big aspirin pill they come only when they hurt
you pray in your distress and in your need would that you might also pray in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance
dont pray when it rains if you dont pray when the sun shines
he who cannot pray when the sun is shining will not know how to pray when the clouds come
all those football coaches who hold dressingroom prayers before a game should be forced to attend church once a week
prayer is not merely an occasional impulse to which we respond when we are in trouble prayer is a life attitude
do not have as your motive the desire to be known as a praying man
get an inner chamber in which to pray where no one knows you are praying shut the door and talk to god in secret
nowhere can we get to know the holiness of god and come under his influence and power except in the inner chamber
it has been well said no man can expect to make progress in holiness who is not often and long alone with god
private place and plenty of time are the life of prayer
but thou when thou prayest enter into thy room and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
when you enter your secret chamber take plenty of time before you begin to speak
let quietude wield its influence upon you
let the fact that you are alone assert itself
give your soul time to get released from the many outward things
give god time to play the prelude to prayer for the benefit of your distracted soul
there is no need to get to a place of prayer pray wherever you are
of all things guard against neglecting god in the secret place of prayer
prayer to the patriarchs and prophets was more than the recital of wellknown and wellworn phrasesit was the outpouring of the heart
without the incense of heartfelt prayer even the greatest of cathedrals is dead
follow your own way of speaking to our lord sincerely lovingly confidently and simply as your heart dictates
sincerity is the prime requisite in every approach to the god who  hates all hypocrisy falsehood and deceit
the lords prayer may be committed to memory quickly but it is slowly learnt by heart
god hears no more than the heart speaks and if the heart be dumb god will certainly be dumb
deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it
you cant pray a liei found that out
prayers not felt by us are seldom heard by god
many pray with their lips for that for which their hearts have no desire
god may turn his ears from prattling prayers or preaching prayers but never from penitent believing prayers
two went to pray
better to say one went to brag the other to pray
i pray like a robber asking alms at the door of a farmhouse to which he is ready to set fire
gods ear lies close to the believers lip
heaven is never deaf but when mans heart is dumb
do not pray by heart but with the heart
our prayers must mean something to us if they are to mean anything to god
our prayers must spring from the indigenous soil of our own personal confrontation with the spirit of god in our lives
god eagerly awaits the chance to bless the person whose heart is turned toward him
we must lay before him what is in us not what ought to be in us
in prayer the lips neer act the winning part without the sweet concurrence of the heart
the cry of a young raven is nothing but the natural cry of a creature but your cry if it be sincere is the result of a work of grace in your heart
every time you pray if your prayer is sincere there will be new feeling and new meaning in it which will give you fresh courage and you will understand that prayer is an education
when you pray rather let your heart be without words than your words without heart
he offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea
prayer is a serious thing
we may be taken at our words
prayer at its best is the expression of the total life for all things else being equal our prayers are only as powerful as our lives
and help us this and every day to live more nearly as we pray
my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go
it is not well for a man to pray cream and live skim milk
she heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer
she had to cease to pray
none can pray well but he that lives well
straight praying is never born of crooked conduct
a wicked man in prayer may lift up his hands but he cannot lift up his face
he who prays as he ought will endeavor to live as he prays
we pray pious blether our will is not in it and then we say god does not answer we never asked him for anything
asking means that our wills are in what we ask
it is good for us to keep some account of our prayers that we may not unsay them in our practice
praying which does not result in pure conduct is a delusion
we have missed the whole office and virtue of praying if it does not rectify conduct
it is in the very nature of things that we must quit praying or quit bad conduct
our praying to be strong must be buttressed by holy living
the life of faith perfects the prayer of faith
search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me
when our will wholeheartedly enters into the prayer of christ then we pray correctly
we cannot talk to god strongly when we have not lived for god strongly
the closet cannot be made holy to god when the life has not been holy to god
if we would have god in the closet god must have us out of the closet
there is no way of praying to god but by living to god
men would pray better if they lived better
they would get more from god if they lived more obedient and wellpleasing to god
be not hot in prayer and cold in praise
though smooth be the heartless prayer no ear in heaven will mind it and the finest phrase falls dead if there is no feeling behind it
prayer is the souls sincere desire
prayer is not eloquence but earnestness not the definition of helplessness but the feeling of it not figures of speech but earnestness of soul
prayer is something deeper than words
it is present in the soul before it has been formulated in words
and it abides in the soul after the last words of prayer have passed over our lips
if we rely on the holy spirit we shall find that our prayers become more and more inarticulate and when they are inarticulate reverence grows deeper and deeper
god prefers bad verses recited with a pure heart to the finest verses chanted by the wicked
we cannot all argue but we can all pray we cannot all be leaders but we can all be pleaders we cannot all be mighty in rhetoric but we can all be prevalent in prayer
the best prayers have often more groans than words
in prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart
we ought to act with god in the greatest simplicity speak to him frankly and plainly and implore his assistance in our affairs
prayer is not artful monologue of voice uplifted from the son it is loves tender dialogue between the soul and god
they tell about a fifteenyearold boy in an orphans home who had an incurable stutter
one sunday the minister was detained and the boy volunteered to say the prayer in his stead
he did it perfectly too without a single stutter
later he explained i dont stutter when i talk to god
he loves me
our groanings which cannot be uttered rise to him and tell him better than words how dependent we are upon him
when prayer is a struggle do not worry about the prayers that you cannot pray
you yourself are a prayer to god at that moment
all that is within you cries out to him
and he hears all the pleas that your suffering soul and body are making to him with groanings which cannot be uttered
god can pick sense out of a confused prayer
prayer requires more of the heart than of the tongue
productive prayer requires earnestness not eloquence
just pray for a tough hide and a tender heart
prayer is a fine delicate instrument
to use it right is a great art a holy art
there is perhaps no greater art than the art of prayer
yet the least gifted the uneducated and the poor can cultivate the holy art of prayer
with god there is no need for long speeches
the fewer the words the better the prayer
in prayer more is accomplished by listening than by talking
prayer should be short without giving god almighty reasons why he should grant this or that he knows best what is good for us
god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few
many words do not a good prayer make what counts is the heartfelt desire to commune with god and the faith to back it up
a little lifting of the heart suffices a little remembrance of god one act of inward worship are prayers which however short are nevertheless acceptable to god
there come times when i have nothing more to tell god
if i were to continue to pray in words i would have to repeat what i have already said
at such times it is wonderful to say to god may i be in thy presence lord
i have nothing more to say to thee but i do love to be in thy presence
short prayers pierceth heaven
you are coming to a king large petitions with you bring for his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much
there is no sinner in the world however much at enmity with god who cannot recover gods grace by recourse to mary and by asking her assistance
most christians expect little from god ask little and therefore receive little and are content with little
ye have not because ye ask not
ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss
ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
whether we like it or not asking is the rule of the kingdom
the simple heart that freely asks in love obtains
our immediate temptation will be to ask for specific solutions to specific problems and for the ability to help other people as we have already thought they should be helped
in that case we are asking god to do it our way
it is the will of our heavenly father that we should come to him freely and confidently and make known our desires to him just as we would have our children come freely and of their own accord and speak to us about the things they would like to have
my praying friend continue to make known your desires to god in all things
let him decide whether you are to receive what you ask for or not
let your requests be made known unto god
pray for whatsoever you will
in the name of jesus you have permission not only to stand in the presence of god but also to pray for everything you need
and whatever ye shall ask in my name that will i do
we should not be afraid when praying to god to give expression to a definite desire even though we are in doubt at the time we are praying whether it is really the right thing to pray for or not
we can never know god as it is our privilege to know him by brief repetitions that are requests for personal favors and nothing more
prayer is not only asking it is an attitude of heart that produces an atmosphere in which asking is perfectly natural and jesus says every one that asketh receiveth
helplessness becomes prayer the moment that you go to jesus and speak candidly and confidently with him about your needs
this is to believe
the clue is not to ask in a miserly waythe key is to ask in a grand manner
to avail yourself of his certain wisdom ask of him whatever questions you have
but do not entreat him for that will never be necessary
o lord attend unto my cry
we pray pious blether our will is not in it and then we say god does not answer we never asked him for anything
asking means that our wills are in what we ask
ask the gods nothing excessive
when praying for healing ask great things of god and expect great things from god
but let us seek for that healing that really matters the healing of the heart enabling us to trust god simply face god honestly and live triumphantly
most people do not pray they only beg
prayer is not asking
it is a longing of the soul
prayer in the sense of petition asking for things is a small part of it confession and penitence are its threshold adoration its sanctuary the presence and vision and enjoyment of god its bread and wine
god never denied that soul anything that went as far as heaven to ask it
ask in faith
if your prayer is selfish the answer will be something that will rebuke your selfishness
you may not recognize it as having come at all but it is sure to be there
selfishness is never so exquisitely selfish as when it is on its knees
self turns what would otherwise be a pure and powerful prayer into a weak and ineffective one
i seldom made an errand to god for another but i got something for myself
when we make self the end of prayer it is not worship but selfseeking
we look upon prayer as a means of getting things for ourselves the bible idea of prayer is that we may get to know god himself
pray for one another
intercessory prayer for one who is sinning prevails
god says so
the will of the man prayed for does not come into question at all he is connected with god by prayer and prayer on the basis of the redemption sets the connection working and god gives life
he who prays for his neighbors will be heard for himself
we should say to god as we mingle with our dear ones each day god give them each thy blessing
they need it because they live with me and i am very selfish and unwilling to sacrifice very much for them although i do love them
see to it night and day that you pray for your children
then you will leave them a great legacy of answers to prayer which will follow them all the days of their life
then you may calmly and with a good conscience depart from them even though you may not leave them a great deal of material wealth
religion without humanity is a poor human stuff
god bless all those that i love god bless all those that love me god bless all those that love those that i love and all those that love those that love me
no one who has had a unique experience with prayer has a right to withhold it from others
thou who has given so much to me give one thing more a grateful heart
if the only prayer you say in your whole life is thank you that would suffice
pray without ceasing
in everything give thanks
fear of trouble present and future often blinds us to the numerous small blessings we enjoy silencing our prayers of praise and thanksgiving
god deserves far more praise than any of us could ever give him
our father let the spirit of gratitude so prevail in our hearts that we may manifest thy spirit in our lives
a sensible thanksgiving for mercies received is a mighty prayer in the spirit of god
it prevails with him unspeakably
god receives little thanks even for his greatest gifts
it is not only blessed to give thanks it is also of vital importance to our prayer life in general
if we have noted the lords answers to our prayers and thanked him for what we have received of him then it becomes easier for us and we get more courage to pray for more
to stand on one leg and prove gods existence is a very different thing from going down on ones knees and thanking him
our thanks to god should always precede our requests
jesus is moved to happiness every time he sees that you appreciate what he has done for you
grip his pierced hand and say to him i thank thee savior because thou hast died for me
thank him likewise for all the other blessings he has showered upon you from day to day
it brings joy to jesus
the idea of thanking staff should mean giving them something that they would never buy for themselves
let us thank god heartily as often as we pray that we have his spirit in us to teach us to pray
thanksgiving will draw our hearts out to god and keep us engaged with him it will take our attention from ourselves and give the spirit room in our hearts
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving
when we succeed in truly thanking god we feel good at heart
the reason is that we have been created to give glory to god now and forevermore
and every time we do so we feel that we are in harmony with his plans and purposes for our lives
then we are truly in our element
that is why it is so blessed
dont be timid when you pray rather batter the very gates of heaven with storms of prayer
let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it be his life ever so wicked for prayer is the way to amend it and without prayer such amendment will be much more difficult
how those holy men of old could storm the battlements above
when there was no way to look but up they lifted up their eyes to god who made the hills with unshakable confidence
cold prayers shall never have any warm answers
we must wrestle earnestly in prayer like men contending with a deadly enemy for life
we may as well not pray at all as offer our prayers in a lifeless manner
there is neither encouragement nor room in bible religion for feeble desires listless efforts lazy attitudes all must be strenuous urgent ardent
flamed desires impassioned unwearied insistence delight heaven
god would have his children incorrigibly in earnest and persistently bold in their efforts
heaven is too busy to listen to halfhearted prayers or to respond to popcalls
our whole being must be in our praying
it is only when the whole heart is gripped with the passion of prayer that the lifegiving fire descends for none but the earnest man gets access to the ear of god
to say prayers in a decent delicate way is not heavy work
but to pray really to pray till hell feels the ponderous stroke to pray till the iron gates of difficulty are opened till the mountains of obstacles are removed till the mists are exhaled and the clouds are lifted and the sunshine of a cloudless day brightensthis is hard work but it is gods work and mans best labor
importunity is a condition of prayer
we are to press the matter not with vain repetitions but with urgent repetitions
we repeat not to count the times but to gain the prayer
we cannot quit praying because heart and soul are in it
we pray with all perseverance
we hang to our prayers because by them we live
we press our pleas because we must have them or die
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
from silly devotions and from sourfaced saints good lord deliver us
let me burn out for god  prayer is the great thing
oh that i may be a man of prayer
look as a painted man is no man and as painted fire is no fire so a cold prayer is no prayer
there must be fired affections before our prayers will go up
bear up the hands that hang down by faith and prayer support the tottering knees
storm the throne of grace and persevere therein and mercy will come down
do not work so hard for christ that you have no strength to pray for prayer requires strength
in fellowship alone to god with faith draw near approach his courts besiege his throne with all the power of prayer
productive prayer requires earnestness not eloquence
jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer
men must be in earnest when they kneel at gods footstool
too often we get fainthearted and quit praying at the point where we ought to begin
we let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest
our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will
we must move from asking god to take care of the things that are breaking our hearts to praying about the things that are breaking his heart
we cannot ask in behalf of christ what christ would not ask himself if he were praying
thou who has given so much to me give one thing more a grateful heart
we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy
our prayers should be for blessings in general for god knows best what is good for us
lord take my lips and speak through them take my mind and think through it take my heart and set it on fire
not what we wish but what we need oh
let your grace supply the good unasked in mercy grant the ill though asked deny
we should pray for a sane mind in a sound body
if we are to pray aright perhaps it is quite necessary that we pray contrary to our own heart
not what we want to pray is important but what god wants us to pray
the richness of the word of god ought to determine our prayer not the poverty of our heart
o lord help me not to despise or oppose what i do not understand
we are going home to many who cannot read
so lord make us to be bibles so that those who cannot read the book can read it in us
gods promises are to be our pleas in prayer
help me to work and pray help me to live each day that all i do may say thy kingdom come
we must pray for more prayer for it is the worlds mightiest healing force
o lord let me not live to be useless
god give me work till my life shall end and life till my work is done
the whole meaning of prayer is that we may know god
watch your motive before god have no other motive in prayer than to know him
for we know not what we should pray for
pray a little each day in a childlike way for the spirit of prayer
if you feel that you know as yet very little concerning the deep things of prayer and what prayer really is then pray for the spirit of prayer
there is nothing he would rather do than unveil to you the grace of prayer
god does not exist to answer our prayers but by our prayers we come to discern the mind of god
i sit beside my lonely fire and pray for wisdom yet for calmness to remember or courage to forget
the first petition that we are to make to almighty god is for a good conscience the next for health of mind and then of body
when we in prayer seek only the glorification of the name of god then we are in complete harmony with the spirit of prayer
then our hearts are at rest both while we pray and after we have prayed
then we can wait for the lord
grant that we may not so much seek to be understood as to understand
grant me the courage not to give up even though i think it is hopeless
prayer for worldly goods is worse than fruitless but prayer for strength of soul is that passion of the soul which catches the gift it seeks
just pray for a tough hide and a tender heart
the purpose of prayer is not to inform god of our needs but to invite him to rule our lives
dont pray to escape trouble
dont pray to be comfortable in your emotions
pray to do the will of god in every situation
nothing else is worth praying for
o lord forgive what i have been sanctify what i am and order what i shall be
spread out your petition before god and then say thy will not mine be done
the sweetest lesson i have learned in gods school is to let the lord choose for me
show me your ways o lord teach me your paths guide me in your truth and teach me for you are god my savior and my hope is in you all day long
the possibilities of prayer are found in its allying itself with the purposes of god for gods purposes and mans praying are the combination of all potent and omnipotent forces
if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us
i would have no desire other than to accomplish thy will
teach me to pray pray thyself in me
true prayer brings a persons will into accordance with gods will not the other way around
do not forget that prayer is ordained for the purpose of glorifying the name of god
therefore whether you pray for big things or for little things say to god if it will glorify thy name then grant my prayer and help me
it is only when we pray for something according to the will of god that we have the promise of being heard and answered
i used to pray that god would do this or that now i pray that god will make his will known to me
how many of us will ever sit bow our heads and pray lord show me where im wrong
women dont have halos built in
a chinese christian prayed every day  lord reform thy world beginning with me
create in me a clean heart o god
do not pray for easy lives pray to be stronger men
do not pray for tasks equal to your powers pray for powers equal to your tasks
the wise man in the storm prays god not for safety from danger but for deliverance from fear
it is quite useless knocking at the door of heaven for earthly comfort
its not the sort of comfort they supply there
pray not for lighter burdens but for stronger backs
prayer covers the whole of mans life
there is no thought feeling yearning or desire however low trifling or vulgar we may deem it which if it affects our real interest or happiness we may not lay before god and be sure of sympathy
his nature is such that our often coming does not tire him
the whole burden of the whole life of every man may be rolled on to god and not weary him though it has wearied man
what a friend we have in jesus all our sins and griefs to bear
what a privilege to carry everything to god in prayer
have we trials and temptations
is there trouble anywhere
we should never be discouraged take it to the lord in prayer
are we weak and heavy laden cumbered with a load of care
precious savior still our refuge take it to the lord in prayer
o what peace we often forfeit o what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer
take my will and make it thine it shall be no longer mine take my heart it is thine own it shall be thy royal throne
and since he bids me seek his face believe his word and trust his grace ill cast on him my every care and wait for thee sweet hour of prayer
we lie to god in prayer if we do not rely on him afterwards
prayer puts gods work in his handsand keeps it there
i know not by what methods rare but this i know god answers prayer
i know not if the blessing sought will come in just the guise i thought
i leave my prayer to him alone whose will is wiser than my own
do what you can and pray for what you cannot yet do
do not want things to turn out as they seem best to you but as god pleases
then you will be free from confusion and thankful in prayer
o lord you know what is best for me
let this or that be done as you please
give what you will how much you will and when you will
spread out your petition before god and then say thy will not mine be done
the sweetest lesson i have learned in gods school is to let the lord choose for me
casting all your care upon him for he careth for you
do not strive in your own strength cast yourself at the feet of the lord jesus and wait upon him in the sure confidence that he is with you and works in you
strive in prayer let faith fill your heartso will you be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
a humble and contrite heart knows that it can merit nothing before god and that all that is necessary is to be reconciled to ones helplessness and let our holy and almighty god care for us just as an infant surrenders himself to his mothers care
cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee
the only prayer which a wellmeaning man can pray is o ye gods give me whatever is fitting unto me
our prayer life will become restful when it really dawns upon us that we have done all we are supposed to do when we have spoken to him about it
from the moment we have left it with him it is his responsibility
god tells us to burden him with whatever burdens us
this is what i found out about religion it gives you courage to make decisions you must make in a crisis and then the confidence to leave the result to a higher power
only by trust in god can a man carrying responsibility find repose
before we can pray lord thy kingdom come we must be willing to pray my kingdom go
we need to learn to know him so well that we feel safe when we have left our difficulties with him
to know jesus in that way is a prerequisite of all true prayer
no prayers can be heard which do not come from a forgiving heart
i firmly believe a great many prayers are not answered because we are not willing to forgive someone
when you pray for anyone you tend to modify your personal attitude toward him
when my children do wrong i ache to hear their stumbling requests for forgiveness
im sure our heavenly father aches even more deeply to hear from us
there is nothing that makes us love a man so much as praying for him
ask gods blessing on your work but dont ask him to do it for you
prayer indeed is good but while calling on the gods a man should himself lend a hand
prayer among sane people has never superseded practical efforts to secure the desired end
it is vain to expect our prayers to be heard if we do not strive as well as pray
he who labors as he prays lifts his heart to god with his hands
pray as if everything depended on god and work as if everything depended upon man
work as if everything depended upon work and pray as if everything depended upon prayer
help yourself and heaven will help you
work as if you were to live one hundred years pray as if you were to die tomorrow
god helps those who help themselves
god help those who do not help themselves
god gives the nuts but he does not crack them
god gives every bird its food but he does not throw it into the nest
pray devoutly but hammer stoutly
the ancient mariner said to neptune during a great storm o god you will save me if you wish but i am going to go on holding my tiller straight
pray to god but keep rowing to shore
call on god but row away from the rocks
to the man who himself strives earnestly god also lends a helping hand
trust in allah but tie your camel first
it is vain to ask of the gods what man is capable of supplying for himself
heaven neer helps the men who will not act
to give pleasure to a single heart by a single kind act is better than a thousand headbowings in prayer
always look for ways to act upon the faith you display in your prayers
you can do more than pray after you have prayed but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed
visualize prayerize actionize and your wishes will come true
there is a time for all things a time to preach and a time to pray but those times have passed away there is a time to fight and that time has come
prayer is often a temptation to bank on a miracle of god instead of on a moral issue ie it is much easier to ask god to do my work than it is to do it myself
until we are disciplined properly we will always be inclined to bank on gods miracles and refuse to do the moral thing ourselves
it is our job and it will never be done unless we do it
some people think that prayer just means asking for things and if they fail to receive exactly what they asked for they think the whole thing is a fraud
poverty chastity and obedience are extremely difficult
but there are always the graces if you will pray for them
real prayer seeks an audience and an answer
there are three answers to prayer yes no and wait awhile
it must be recognized that no is an answer
there are four ways god answers prayer no not yet no i love you too much yes i thought youd never ask yes and heres more
no answer to prayer is an indication of our merit every answer to prayer is an indication of gods mercy
god answers all true prayer either in kind or in kindness
god is not a cosmic bellboy for whom we can press a button to get things
more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of
when i have a problem i pray about it and what comes to mind and stays there i assume to be my answer
and this has been right so often that i know it is gods answer
whenever the insistence is on the point that god answers prayer we are off the track
the meaning of prayer is that we get hold of god not of the answer
i think christians fail so often to get answers to their prayers because they do not wait long enough on god
they just drop down and say a few words and then jump up and forget it and expect god to answer them
such praying always reminds me of the small boy ringing his neighbors doorbell and then running away as fast as he can go
when i pray coincidences happen and when i dont they dont
our understanding of god is the answer to prayer getting things from god is gods indulgence of us
when god stops giving us things he brings us into the place where we can begin to understand him
if god sees that my spiritual life will be furthered by giving the things for which i ask then he will give them but that is not the end of prayer
the end of prayer is that i come to know god himself
you say but he has not answered
he has he is so near to you that his silence is the answer
his silence is big with terrific meaning that you cannot understand yet but presently you will
when we pray in the name of jesus the answers are in accordance with his nature and if we think our prayers are unanswered it is because we are not interpreting the answer along this line
gods silences are his answers
if we only take as answers those that are visible to our senses we are in a very elementary condition of grace
who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered
god has editing rights over our prayers
he will edit them correct them bring them in line with his will and then hand them back to us to be resubmitted
the great tragedy of life is not unanswered prayer but unoffered prayer
my prayers my god flow from what i am not i think thy answers make me what i am
the greatest blessing of prayer is not receiving the answer but being the kind of person god can trust with his answer
god answers prayer with certainty
wish fulfillment is something else
god delays but doesnt forget
a generous prayer is never presented in vain the petition may be refused but the petitioner is always i believe rewarded by some gracious visitation
i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just
the answer of our prayers is secured by the fact that in rejecting them god would in a certain sense deny his own nature
there are two main pitfalls on the road to mastery of the art of prayer
if a person gets what he asks for his humility is in danger
if he fails to get what he asks for he is apt to lose confidence
indeed no matter whether prayer seems to be succeeding or failing humility and confidence are two virtues which are absolutely essential
if we be empty and poor it is not because gods hand is straitened but ours is not opened
i firmly believe a great many prayers are not answered because we are not willing to forgive someone
i know not by what methods rare but this i know god answers prayer
i know not if the blessing sought will come in just the guise i thought
i leave my prayer to him alone whose will is wiser than my own
our prayers are often filled with selfish wants god always answers with what we need
we ought not to tolerate for a minute the ghastly and grievous thought that god will not answer prayer
though i am weak yet god when prayed cannot withhold his conquering aid
beyond our utmost wants his love and power can bless to praying souls he always grants more than they can express
whatever things ye desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them
the firmament of the bible is ablaze with answers to prayer
never was a faithful prayer lost
some prayers have a longer voyage than others but then they return with their richer lading at last so that the praying soul is a gainer by waiting for an answer
in gethsemane the holiest of all petitioners prayed three times that a certain cup might pass from him
it did not
after that the idea that prayer is recommended to us as a sort of infallible gimmick may be dismissed
sometimes  god answers our prayers in the way our parents do who reply to the pleas of their children with not just now or ill have to think about that for a little while
answered prayers cover the field of providential history as flowers cover western prairies
in seasons of distress and grief my soul has often found relief and oft escaped the tempters snare by thy return sweet hour of prayer
god answers sharp and sudden on some prayers and thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face
a gauntlet with a gift int
our prayers run along one road and gods answers by another and by and by they meet
gods chief gift to those who seek him is himself
asking for anything is allowed with the understanding that gods answers come from gods perspective
they are not always in harmony with our expectations for only he knows the whole story
may the lord answer you when you are in distress may the name of the god of jacob protect you may he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from zion
just when i need him he is my all answering when upon him i call tenderly watching lest i should fall
the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withheld the request of his lips
those who trade with heaven by prayer grow rich by quick returns
the great thing in prayer is to feel that we are putting our supplications into the bosom of omnipotent love
when you go to your knees god will help you stand up to anything
prayer has marked the trees across the wilderness of a skeptical world to direct the traveler in distress and all paths lead to a single light
amazing things start happening when we start praying
prayer enlarges the heart until it is capable of containing gods gift of himself
the man who prays grows and the muscles of the soul swell from this whipcord to iron bands
prayer opens our eyes that we may see ourselves and others as god sees us
it is impossible to lose your footing while on your knees
the exercise of prayer in those who habitually exert it must be regarded by us doctors as the most adequate and normal of all the pacifiers of the mind and calmers of the nerves
the influence of prayer on the human mind and body  can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy greater intellectual vigor moral stamina and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying human relationships
the essence of prayer even of a mystical experience is the way we are altered to see everything from its lifefilled dimension
prayer puts gods work in his handsand keeps it there
it is hard to wait and press and pray and hear no voice but stay till god answers
prayer is a kind of calling home every day
and there can come to you a serenity a feeling of athomeness in gods universe a peace that the world can neither give nor disturb a fresh courage a new insight a holy boldness that youll never never get any other way
pray because you have a father not because it quietens you and give him time to answer
perhaps one of the greatest rewards of meditation and prayer is the sense of belonging that comes to us
we impoverish god in our minds when we say there must be answers to our prayers on the material plane the biggest answers to our prayers are in the realm of the unseen
our lord never referred to unanswered prayer he taught that prayers are always answered
he ever implied that prayers were answered rightly because of the heavenly fathers wisdom
as white snow flakes fall quietly and thickly on a winter day answers to prayer will settle down upon you at every step you take even to your dying day
the story of your life will be the story of prayer and answers to prayer
god is a rich and bountiful father and he does not forget his children nor withhold from them anything which it would be to their advantage to receive
just as an earthly father knows what is best for his childrens welfare so does god take into consideration the particular needs of his human family and meets them out of his wonderful storehouse
prayer brings a good spirit in our homes
for god hears prayer
heaven itself would come down to our homes
and even though we who constitute the home all have our imperfections and our failings our home would through gods answer to prayer become a little paradise
gods willingness to answer our prayers exceeds our willingness to give good and necessary things to our children just as far as gods ability goodness and perfection exceed our infirmities and evil
the greatest answer to prayer is that i am brought into a perfect understanding with god and that alters my view of actual things
gods nothings are his most positive answers
we have to stay on god and wait
never try to help god to fulfill his word
the shower of answers to your prayers will continue to your dying hour
nor will it cease then
when you pass out from beneath the shower your dear ones will step into it
every prayer and every sigh which you have uttered for them and their future welfare will in gods time descend upon them as a gentle rain of answers to prayer
if a door slams shut it means that god is pointing to an open door further on down
we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good
prayer is the easiest and hardest of all things the simplest and the sublimest the weakest and the most powerful its results lie outside the range of human possibilitiesthey are limited only by the omnipotence of god
prayer like faith obtains promises enlarges their operation and adds to the measure of their results
if we will make use of prayer to call down upon ourselves and others those things which will glorify the name of god then we shall see the strongest and boldest promises of the bible about prayer fulfilled
then we shall see such answers to prayer as we had never thought were possible
let it be your business every day in the secrecy of the inner chamber to meet the holy god
you will be repaid for the trouble it may cost you
the reward will be sure and rich
one great effect of prayer is that it enables the soul to command the body
by obedience i make my body submissive to my soul but prayer puts my soul in command of my body
if we pray for anything according to the will of god we already have what we pray for the moment we ask it
we do not know exactly when it will arrive but we have learned to know god through the spirit of god and have learned to leave this in his hands and to live just as happily whether the answer arrives immediately or later
it is gods will not only to hear our prayer but to give us the best and the richest answer which he the almighty and omniscient god can devise
he will send us the answer when it will benefit us and his cause the most
if god does not give you something you ask for wait on him
he will speak with you tenderly and sympathetically about the matter until you yourself understand that he cannot grant your prayer
the potency of prayer hath subdued the strength of fire it hath bridled the rage of lions hushed anarchy to rest extinguished wars appeased the elements expelled demons burst the chains of death expanded the gates of heaven assuaged diseases repelled frauds rescued cities from destruction stayed the sun in its course and arrested the progress of the thunderbolt
be sure to remember that nothing in your daily life is so insignificant and so inconsequential that the lord will not help you by answering your prayer
more tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones
true prayer always receives what it asks foror something better
be thankful that gods answers are wiser than your answers
god punishes us mildly by ignoring our prayers and severely by answering them
when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers
god alone fully understands what each one of us needs we make mistakes continually and pray for things which would be harmful to us if we received them
afterwards we see our mistakes and realize that god is good and wise in not giving us these things even though we plead ever so earnestly for them
when the gods are angry with a man they give him what he asks for
i have lived to thank god that all my prayers have not been answered
prayer is the supreme activity of all that is noblest in our personality and the essential nature of prayer is faith
prayer is the voice of faith
the prayer that is faithless is fruitless
a saint is to put forth his faith in prayer and afterwards follow his prayer with faith
the prayer of faith is the only power in the universe to which the great jehovah yields
prayers are heard in heaven very much in proportion to your faith
little faith will get very great mercies but great faith still greater
the beginning of anxiety is the end of faith and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety
teach me o god not to torture myself not to make a martyr out of myself through stifling reflection but rather teach me to breathe deeply in faith
faith is the fountain of prayer and prayer should be nothing else but faith exercised
without faith it is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is
when we pray we link ourselves with an inexhaustible motive power
jesus christ is a god whom we approach without pride and before whom we humble ourselves without despair
granting that we are always in the presence of god yet it seems to me that those who pray are in his presence in a very different sense for they as it were see that he is looking upon them while others may go for days on end without even once recollecting that god sees them
why is it when we talk to god were said to be praying but when god talks to us were schizophrenic
it is in recognizing the actual presence of god that we find prayer no longer a chore but a supreme delight
essentially prayer is based on a relationship
we dont converse freely with someone we dont know
we bare our souls and disclose our hidden secrets only to someone we trust
i who still pray at morning and at eve thrice in my life perhaps have truly prayed thrice stirred below conscious self have felt that perfect disenthrallment which is god
prayer is the souls breathing itself into the bosom of its heavenly father

it is the root the fountain the mother of a thousand blessings
some pray to marry the man they love my prayer will somewhat vary i humbly pray to heaven above that i love the man i marry

the deepest wishes of the heart find expression in secret prayer
we are never more like christ than in prayers of intercession
the spirit of prayer is the fruit and token of the spirit of adoption
if we do not love one another we certainly shall not have much power with god in prayer
keep us lord so awake in the duties of our calling that we may sleep in thy peace and wake in thy glory
i find in the psalms much the same range of mood and expression as i perceive within my own life of prayer
i am used to praying when i am alone thank god
but when i come together with other people when i need more than ever to pray i still cannot get used to it
nothing is discussed more and practiced less than prayer
i always love to begin a journey on sundays because i shall have the prayers of the church to preserve all that travel by land or by water
nor it is an objection to say that we must understand a prayer if it is to have its true effect
that simply is not the case
who understands the wisdom of a flower
yet we can take pleasure in it
i would rather stand against the cannons of the wicked than against the prayers of the righteous
restraining prayer we cease to fight prayer keeps the christians armor bright and satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his knees

in the calm of sweet communion let thy daily work be done in the peace of souloutpouring care be banished patience won and if earth with its enchantments seek thy spirit to enthrall ere thou listen ere thou answer turn to jesus tell him all
god warms his hands at mans heart when he prays
turn your doubts to question turn your question to prayers turn your prayers to god
prayer like radium is a luminous and selfgenerating form of energy
whatever you do in revenge against your brother will appear all at once in your heart at the time of payer
any concern too small to be turned into a prayer is too small to be made into a burden
never say you will pray about a thing pray about it
doubt not but god who sits on high thy secret prayers can hear when a dead wall thus cunningly conveys soft whispers to the ear
the granting of prayer when offered in the name of jesus reveals the fathers love to him and the honor which he has put upon him
a prayer in its simplest definition is merely a wish turned heavenward
they never sought in vain that sought the lord aright
prayer is the voice of faith
prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin
such an error would impede true religion

never try to reason the prejudice out of a man
it was not reasoned into him and cannot be reasoned out
since my little daughter is only half jewish would it be alright if she went into the pool only up to her waist
there are only two ways to be quite unprejudiced and impartial
one is to be completely ignorant
the other is to be completely indifferent
prejudice is the child of ignorance
passion and prejudice govern the world only under the name of reason
how it infuriates a bigot when he is forced to drag out his dark convictions
everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences
no one can eliminate prejudices  just recognize them
we are chameleons and our partialities and prejudices change places with an easy and blessed facility
fortunately for serious minds a bias recognized is a bias sterilized
without the aid of prejudice and custom i should not be able to find my way across the room
one may no more live in the world without picking up the moral prejudices of the world than one will be able to go to hell without perspiring
we hate some persons because we do not know them and will not know them because we hate them
the mind of a bigot is like the pupil of the eye the more light you pour upon it the more it will contract
it is not healthy when a nation lives within a nation as coloured americans are living inside america
a nation cannot live confident of its tomorrow if its refugees are among its own citizens
of all the injuries inflicted by racism on people of colour the most corrosive is the wound within the internalized racism that leads some victims at unspeakable cost to their own sense of self to embrace the values of their oppressors

my movements to the chair of government will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit who is going to the place of his execution
congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
our liberty depends on the freedom of the press and that cannot be limited without being lost
the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty and can never be restrained but by despotic governments
freedom of conscience of education of speech of assembly are among the very fundamentals of democracy and all of them would be nullified should freedom of the press ever be successfully challenged
freedom of the press is the staff of life for any vital democracy
you must stir it and stump it and blow your own trumpet or trust me you havent a chance
pride is seldom delicate it will please itself with very mean advantages
the truly proud man is satisfied with his own good opinion and does not seek to make converts to it
pride is the mask of ones own faults
pride is the direct appreciation of oneself
there is a certain noble pride through which merits shine brighter than through modesty
the sun will set without thy assistance
when a proud man hears another praised he feels himself injured
a confessional passage has probably never been written that didnt stink a little bit of the writers pride in having given up his pride
i do not believe that any peacock envies another peacock his tail because every peacock is persuaded that his own tail is the finest in the world
the consequence of this is that peacocks are peaceable birds

pride ruined the angels
pride that dines on vanity sups on contempt
the proud hate pride  in others

pride and weakness are siamese twins
pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall
in pride in reasning pride our error lies all quit their sphere and rush into the skies
pride still is aiming at the blessd abodes men would be angels angels would be gods
the infinitely little have pride infinitely great

while we have prisons it matters little which of us occupy the cells
under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison
i know not whether laws be right or whether laws be wrong all that we know who lie in gaol is that the wall is strong and that each day is like a year a year whose days are long

life has no smooth road for any of us and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend over steep ways to the stars fulfills itself
when lifes problems seem overwhelming look around and see what other people are coping with
you may consider yourself fortunate
if all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion most people would be content to take their own and depart

shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies and not be the biggest pygmy that he can
the man with insight enough to admit his limitations comes nearest to perfection
the one important thing i have learned over the years is the difference between taking ones work seriously and taking ones self seriously
the first is imperative and the second is disastrous
growth begins when we start to accept our own weakness
to dream of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are
of all the young men in america only a few hundred can get into major league baseball and of these only a handful in a decade can get into the hall of fame
so it goes in all human activity

some become multimillionaires and chairmen of the board and some of us must be content to play baseball at company picnics or manage a credit union without pay
at thirty a man should know himself like the palm of his hand know the exact number of his defects and qualities
and above all accept these things
no man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character
you cant make the duchess of windsor into rebecca of sunnybrook farm
the facts of life are very stubborn things
sometimes it is more important to discover what one cannot do than what one can do
learn to  be what you are and learn to resign with a good grace all that you are not
we cannot all be masters
to do all that one is able to do is to be a man to do all that one would like to do is to be a god
no one is expected to achieve the impossible
a hero is a man who does what he can
it is only fools who keep straining at high c all their lives
may god  let me strive for attainable things
despair is the price one pays for setting himself an impossible aim
we would have to settle for the elegant goal of becoming ourselves
a great obstacle to happiness is to expect too much happiness
there is a proper balance between not asking enough of oneself and asking or expecting too much
i hope to work support my children and die quietly without pain
as we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities
striving for excellence motivates you striving for perfection is demoralizing
it is enough that i am of value to somebody today
a tomb now suffices him for whom the whole world was not sufficient
to wish to act like angels while we are still in this world is nothing but folly
it isnt important to come out on top what matters is to be the one who comes out alive
i long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble
i cannot do everything but still i can do something and because i cannot do everything i will not refuse to do something i can do
do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections
happy the man who early learns the wide chasm that lies between his wishes and his powers
being a parent is tough
if you just want a wonderful little creature to love you can get a puppy
you never conquer a mountain
you stand on the summit a few moments then the wind blows your footprints away
if we are to survive on this planet there must be compromises
real life is to most men  a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible
he who cannot do what he wants must make do with what he can
what has always made a hell on earth has been that man has tried to make it his heaven
good is not good where better is expected
nobody has things just as he would like them
the thing to do is to make a success with what material i have
it is a sheer waste of time and soulpower to imagine what i would do if things were different
they are not different
people are lucky and unlucky  according to the ratio between what they get and what they have been led to expect
we must like what we have when we dont have what we like
better is the enemy of the good
if you aspire to the highest place it is no disgrace to stop at the second or even the third place
genius does what it must talent does what it can
a hero is a man who does what he can
nature is what you may do
there is much you may not do
results are what you expect consequences are what you get
the resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering
to expect life to be tailored to our specifications is to invite frustration
each of us does in effect strike a series of deals or compromises between the wants and longings of the inner self and an outer environment that offers certain possibilities and sets certain limitations
man is the only animal that laughs and weeps for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they might have been
we do not write as we want but as we can
every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression
the chasm is never completely bridged
we all have the conviction perhaps illusory that we have much more to say than appears on the paper
a body shouldnt heed what might be
hes got to do with what is
the chief pang of most trials is not so much the actual suffering itself as our own spirit of resistance to it
the greatest and most important problems in life are all in a certain sense insoluble
they can never be solved but only outgrown
the art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them
life has not taught me to expect nothing but she has taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors
knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness
dont spend time beating on a wall hoping to transform it into a door
if i were to wish for anything i should not wish for wealth and power but for the passionate sense of the potential for the eye which ever young and ardent sees the possible  what wine is so sparkling so fragrant so intoxicating as possibility
wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it cant bring down
it is impossible to control creation
to seek fulfillment is to invite frustration
half the unhappiness in the world is due to the failure of plans which were never reasonable and often impossible
there is an illusion that has much to do with  most of our unhappiness
we expect too much
a fool or idiot is one who expects things to happen that never can happen
shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies and not be the biggest pygmy that he can
life is a compromise of what your ego wants to do what experience tells you to do and what your nerves let you do
no doctor i dont want to grow young again
i just want to keep on growing old
what we call reality is an agreement that people have arrived at to make life more livable
there is no such thing as pure pleasure some anxiety always goes with it
when somebody tells you nothing is impossible ask him to dribble a football
no country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time
the most important thing in marriage is not happiness but stability
so often we search out the impossible and then throw ourselves into trying to do it
nothing is so good as it seems beforehand
prospect is often better than possession
the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition
tis expectation makes a blessing dear heaven were not heaven if we knew what it were
life is so constructed that the event does not cannot will not match the expectation
there is no greater enemy to those who would please than expectation
to dream too much of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are
too many people miss the silver lining because theyre expecting gold
for people who live on expectations to face up to their realization is something of an ordeal
my expectationswhich i extended whenever i came close to accomplishing my goalsmade it impossible ever to feel satisfied with my success
every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster
i sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is but it does not admit of holidays
there is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but boys it is all hell
war is not an adventure
it is a disease
it is like typhus
in combat life is short nasty and brutish
the issues of national policy which brought him into war are irrelevant to the combat soldier he is concerned with his literal life chances
in war more than anywhere else in the world things happen differently from what we had expected and look differently when near from what they did at a distance
in spite of all of the training you get and the precautions you take to keep yourself alive its largely a matter of luck that decides whether or not you get killed
moderation in war is imbecility
when ones expectations are reduced to zero one really appreciates everything one does have
i like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do
life didnt promise to be wonderful
we never enjoy perfect happiness our most fortunate successes are mingled with sadness some anxieties always perplex the reality of our satisfaction
do not commit the error common among the young of assuming that if you cannot save the whole of mankind you have failed
the art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them
if one considered life as a simple loan one would perhaps be less exacting
why are we surprised when fig trees bear figs
those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly
i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat
theres no map theres no master plan theres just people
every writer i know has trouble writing
men expect too much do too little
human kind cannot bear very much reality
if anything is poisoning our lives and weakening our society it is reality  and not the fabrication of television writers and producers
there is no reality except the one contained within us
that is why so many people live such an unreal life
they take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself
nothing which is at all times and in every way agreeable to us can have objective reality
it is of the very nature of the real that it should have sharp corners and rough edges that it should be resistant should be itself
dreamfurniture is the only kind on which you never stub your toes or bang your knee
facts as facts do not always create a spirit of reality because reality is a spirit
we take our shape it is true within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth and yet it is precisely through our dependence on this reality that we are most endlessly betrayed
you too must not count overmuch on your reality as you feel it today since like that of yesterday it may prove an illusion for you tomorrow
all our interior world is reality  and that perhaps more so than our apparent world
the field of consciousness is tiny
it accepts only one problem at a time
get into a fist fight put your mind on the strategy of the fight and you will not feel the other fellows punches
a life based on reason will always require to be balanced by an occasional bout of violent and irrational emotion for the instinctual tribes must be satisfied
analysis kills spontaneity
the grain once ground into flour springs and germinates no more
facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
i like reality
it tastes of bread
the time is comin whin not more thin hath iv usll be rale an th restll be rubber plastic
to see what is in front of ones nose needs a constant struggle
we do not fight for the real but for shadows we make a flag is a piece of cloth and a word is a sound but we make them something neither cloth nor a sound tokens of love and hate black sorcery stones
where i cannot satisfy my reason i love to humour my fancy
when the human mind exists in the light of reason and no more than reason we may say with absolute certainty that man and all that made him will be in that instant gone
i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning
reason is gods gift but so are the passions
reason is as guilty as passion
the man who is master of his passions is reasons slave
human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate and she is fate
reason deserves to be called a prophet for in showing up the consequence and effect of our actions in the present does it not tell us what the future will be
the difference between the reason of man and the instinct of the beast is this that the beast does but know but the man knows that he knows
reason is also choice
reason is an emotion for the sexless
the last advance of reason is to recognize that it is surpassed by innumerable things it is feeble if it cannot realize that
all our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling
reason is the mistress and queen of all things
he who will not reason is a bigot he who cannot is a fool and he who dares not is a slave
reason can in general do more than blind force
if i go to heaven i want to take my reason with me
come now and let us reason together
error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it
human reason is like a drunken man on horseback set it up on one side and it tumbles over on the other
you know my friends with what a brave carouse i made a second marriage in my house divorced old barren reason from my bed and took the daughter of the vine to spouse
the feast of reason and the flow of soul
every why hath a wherefore
i have no other but a womans reason
i think him so because i think him so
many are destined to reason wrongly others not to reason at all and others to persecute those who do reason
there are so many people with all kinds of lucky things happening to them and they dont know how to use it
probably any successful career has x number of breaks in it and maybe the difference between successful people and those who arent superachievers is taking advantage of those breaks
to get it right be born with luck or else make it
you must always be open to your luck
you cannot force it but you can recognize it
genius is the gold in the mine talent is the miner that works and brings it out
it is one thing to be gifted and quite another thing to be worthy of ones own gift
talent on its own sat gracefully only on the very young
after a certain age it was what you did with it that counted
a wise man turns chance into good fortune
luck  taps once in a lifetime at everybodys door but if industry does not open it luck goes away
when something bad happens to me i think im able to deal with it in a pretty good way
that makes me lucky
some people fall apart at the first little thing that happens
its funny but youre sort of a moving target for fortune and you never know when it will befall you
lady luck generally woos those who earnestly enthusiastically unremittingly woo her
luck is good planning carefully executed
what helps luck is a habit of watching for opportunities of having a patient but restless mind of sacrificing ones ease or vanity of uniting a love of detail to foresight and of passing through hard times bravely and cheerfully
luck is believing youre lucky
i think that one can have luck if one tries to create an atmosphere of spontaneity
each mans character shapes his fortunes
chance works for us when we are good captains
motivation triggers luck
good and bad luck is a synonym in the great majority of instances for good and bad judgment
luck is a combination of confidence and getting the breaks
i was born lucky and i have lived lucky
what i had was used
what i still have is being used
lucky
luck is largely a matter of paying attention
your luck is how you treat people
the only sure thing about luck is that it will change
the man who glories in his luck may be overthrown by destiny
there is in the worst of fortune the best of chances for a happy change
it is more easy to get a favor from fortune than to keep it
since lucks a nine days wonder wait their end
fortune is with you for an hour and against you for ten
breaks balance out
the sun dont shine on the same old dogs rear end every day
what the reason of the ant laboriously drags into a heap the wind of accident will collect in one breath
fortune is like the market where many times if you can stay a little the price will fall
the profits of good luck are perishable if you build on fortune you build on sand the more advancement you achieve the more dangers you run
every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour
life is full of chances and changes and the most prosperous of men may  meet with great misfortunes
reforms should begin at home and stay there
at twenty a man is full of fight and hope
he wants to reform the world
when hes seventy he still wants to reform the world but he knows he cant
we are reformers in spring and summer in autumn and winter we stand by the old reformers in the morning conservers at night
reform must come from within not from without
you cannot legislate for virtue
the hole and the patch should be commensurate
to make a crooked stick straight we bend it the contrary way
an indefinable something is to be done in a way nobody knows how at a time nobody knows when that will accomplish nobody knows what
very frequently feminine activity also expresses itself in what is largely a retrospectively oriented pondering over what we ought to have done differently in life and how we ought to have done it or as if under compulsion we make up strings of causal connections
we like to call this thinking though on the contrary it is a form of mental activity that is strangely pointless and unproductive a form that really leads only to selftorture
the only causes of regret are laziness outbursts of temper hurting others prejudice jealousy and envy
if you have behaved badly repent make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time
on no account brood over your wrongdoing
rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean
you always feel when you look it straight in the eye that you could have put more into it could have let yourself go and dug harder
when one door closes another opens
but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we fail to see the one that has opened for us
no doing without some ruing
nobody gets to live life backward
look ahead that is where your future lies
were it not better to forget than to remember and regret
regret for the things we did can be tempered by time it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable
always repenting of wrongs done will never bring my heart to rest
shouldhaves solve nothing
its the next thing to happen that needs thinking about
the error of the past is the success of the future
a mistake is evidence that someone tried to do something
regret is an appalling waste of energy you cant build on it it is good only for wallowing
i have always found that each step we take in life is to be regrettedif we once begin to wonder how many other steps might have been possible
if you cannot get rid of the family skeleton you may as well make it dance
let the dead past bury its dead
the horror of that moment the king went on i shall never forget
you will though the queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it
reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has manynot on your past misfortunes of which all men have some
they say you should not suffer through the past
you should be able to wear it like a loose garment take it off and let it drop
your past is always going to be the way it was
stop trying to change it
the only thing i regret about my past is the length of it
if i had to live my life again id make the same mistakes only sooner
there is no greater sorrow than to recall a happy time in the midst of wretchedness
we should have no regrets

the past is finished
there is nothing to be gained by going over it
whatever it gave us in the experiences it brought us was something we had to know
one must never lose time in vainly regretting the past or in complaining against the changes which cause us discomfort for change is the essence of life
yesterdays errors let yesterday cover
this is another day
are its eyes blurred with maudlin grief for any wasted past
a thousand thousand failures shall not daunt
let dust clasp dust death death i am alive
whatever with the past has gone the best is always yet to come
hindsight is always zo20
i respect only those who resist me but cannot tolerate them
the easiest kind of relationship for me is with 10000 people
the hardest is with one
when the man is at home his standing in society is well known and quietly taken but when he is abroad it is problematical and is dependent on the success of his manners
we rarely confide in those who are better than we are
with three or more people there is something bold in the air direct things get said which would frighten two people alone and conscious of each inch of their nearness to one another
to be three is to be in public  you feel safe
it is always safe to assume that people are more subtle and less sensitive than they seem
the more you let yourself go the less others let you go
at bottom the world isnt a joke
we only joke about it to avoid an issue with someone to let someone know that we know hes there with his questions to disarm him by seeming to have heard and done justice to his side of the standing argument
science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all  the apathy of human beings
it is well to remember that the entire population of the universe with one trifling exception is composed of others
make yourself necessary to somebody
the opinions which we hold of one another our relations with friends and kinsfolk are in no sense permanent save in appearance but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself
i present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship i wish to achieve with you
the ultimate indignity is to be given a bedpan by a stranger who calls you by your first name
i respect only those who resist me but cannot tolerate them

and so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
his sisters and his cousins whom he reckons up by dozens and his aunts
no man will be respected by others who is despised by his own relatives
the worst hatred is that of relatives
relations are simply a tedious pack of people who havent got the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die
a firm belief atthracts facts
they come out iv holes in the ground an cracks in th wall to support belief but they run away frm doubt
dont wait for the last judgment
it takes place every day
a minister is coming down every generation nearer and nearer to the common level of the useful citizen  no oracle at all but a man of more than average moral instincts who if he knows anything knows how little he knows
after all whats a cult
it just means not enough people to make a minority
faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe
it is not enough that a thing be possible for it to be believed
he was of the faith chiefly in the sense that the church he currently did not attend was catholic
as for future life every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities
heathen n a beknighted creature who has the folly to worship something that he can see and feel
im not really a jew just jewish not the whole hog
if you cant believe in god the chances are your god is too small
it is extremely difficult for a jew to be converted for how can he bring himself to believe in the divinity of  another jew
man is a venerating animal
he venerates as easily as he purges himself
when they take away from him the gods of his fathers he looks for others abroad
my own mind is my own church
ones religion is whatever he is most interested in
religion is the way we honour our ancestors errors
the church exists for the sake of those outside it
the writers against religion whilst they oppose every system are wisely careful never to set up any of their own
the idea that he would take his attention away from the universe in order to give me a bicycle with three speeds is just so unlikely i cant go along with it
the pope is barely catholic enough for some converts
the test for a prophet is in the bible
it is this
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken
the three great apostles of practical atheism that make converts without persecuting and retain them without preaching are wealth health and power
to tolerate everything is to teach nothing
we are a rather bigheaded little species in a vast cosmos which can do without us very well
when people cease to believe in god they dont believe in nothing they believe in anything
zen is a way of liberation concerned not with discovering what is good or bad or advantageous but what is
each religion by the help of more or less myth which it takes more or less seriously proposes some method of fortifying the human soul and enabling it to make its peace with its destiny
the good news is that jesus is coming back
the bad news is that hes really pissed off

nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other
it is not a dreamlike state but the somehow insulated state that a great musician achieves in a great performance
hes aware of where he is and what hes doing but his mind is on the playing of his instrument with an internal sense of tightnessit is not merely mechanical it is not only spiritual it is something of both on a different plane and a more remote one

in efforts to soar above our nature we invariably fall below it
the driver knows how much the ox can carry and keeps the ox from being overloaded

do not carry too much
if you could once make up your mind never to undertake more work  than you can carry on calmly quietly without hurry or flurry  and if the instant you feel yourself growing nervous and  out of breath you would stop and take breath you would find this simple commonsense rule doing for you what no prayers or tears could ever accomplish
the deepest personal defeat suffered by human beings is constituted by the difference between what one was capable of becoming and what one has in fact become
what i wanted was to be allowed to do the thing in the world that i did bestwhich i believed then and believe now is the greatest privilege there is
when i did that success found me
i had already learned from more than a decade of political life that i was going to be criticized no matter what i did so i might as well be criticized for something i wanted to do
there is only one successto be able to spend your life in your own way
the only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy  what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be
we are traditionally rather proud of ourselves for having slipped creative work in there between the domestic chores and obligations
im not sure we deserve such big apluses for all that
success based on anything but internal fulfillment is bound to be empty

ask yourself the secret of your success
listen to your answer and practice it
do what you love the money will follow
i am only one but still i am one

do what you feel you have a flair for doing and if you are good enough at it the money will come
if a man has a talent and cannot use it he has failed
if he has a talent and uses only half of it he has partly failed

every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life
sir i would rather be right than be president
he will hew to the line of right let the chips fly where they may
be sure you are right then go ahead
two wrongs can never make a right
let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
right is the eternal sun the world cannot delay its coming
one truth is clear whatever is is right
heaven itself has ordained the right
wherever there is a human being i see godgiven rights inherent in that being whatever may be the sex or complexion
the equal right of all men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the air  it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence
for we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be in this world and others no right
equal rights for all special privileges for none
you risk just as much in being credulous as in being suspicious
our whole way of life today is dedicated to the removal of risk
cradle to grave we are supported insulated and isolated from the risks of life and if we fall our government stands ready with bandaids of every size
any life truly lived is a risky business and if one puts up too many fences against the risks one ends by shutting out life itself
however well organized the foundations of life may be life must always be full of risks
dancing on the edge is the only place to be
it is so tempting to try the most difficult thing possible

there is simply no way you can grow without taking chances
youve got to keep fightingyouve got to risk your life every six months to stay alive
it takes courage to lead a life
any life
theres no such thing as a sure thing
thats why they call it gambling
it is only by risking  that we live at all
life is a risk
to be alive at all involves some risk
this nation was built by men who took riskspioneers who were not afraid of the wilderness business men who were not afraid of failure scientists who were not afraid of the truth thinkers who were not afraid of progress dreamers who were not afraid of action
to live without risk for me would be tantamount to death
it is the business of the future to be dangerous
to achieve anything you must be prepared to dabble on the boundary of disaster
he that will not sail till all dangers are over must never put to sea
the fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore
if we are intended for great ends we are called to great hazards
liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have
as soon as there is life there is danger
one never finds anything perfectly pure and  exempt from danger
he that is not in the war is not out of danger
danger itself is the best remedy for danger
a sharp knife cuts the quickest and hurts the least
its only when we have nothing else to hold onto that were willing to try something very audacious and scary
without danger we cannot get beyond danger
constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them
avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure
the fearful are caught as often as the bold
all reformations seem formidable before they are attempted
what one has not experienced one will never understand in print
doing is a quantum leap from imagining
it is not manly to turn ones back on fortune
be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid
a leader must face danger
he must take the risk and the blame and the brunt of the storm
fortune and love befriend the bold
our safety is not in blindness but in facing our danger
of course people are afraid
but honestly facing that fear seeing it for what it is is the only way of putting it to rest
unless you enter the tigers den you cannot take the cubs
all work of man is as the swimmers a vast ocean threatens to devour him if he front it not bravely it will keep its word
they are surely to be esteemed the bravest spirits who having the clearest sense of both the pains and pleasures of life do not on that account shrink from danger
if one is forever cautious can one remain a human being
an individual dies  when instead of taking risks and hurling himself toward being he cowers within and takes refuge there
few are they who have never had a chance to achieve happinessand fewer those who have taken that chance
you have all eternity to be cautious in when youre dead
without risk faith is an impossibility
who dares nothing need hope for nothing
if youre never scared or embarrassed or hurt it means you never take any chances
it is not because things are difficult that we do not dare it is because we do not dare that they are difficult
only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go
in order to find the edge you must risk going over the edge
make voyages
attempt them
theres nothing else
the faster you go the more chance there is of stubbing your toe but the more chance you have of getting somewhere
taking risks gives me energy
the torment of precautions often exceeds the dangers to be avoided
it is sometimes better to abandon ones self to destiny
what is necessary is never a risk
to render ourselves insensible to pain we must forfeit also the possibilities of happiness
take risks if you win you will be happy if you lose you will be wise
women must think strategically about creating ongoing pressure for change
anything ive ever done that ultimately was worthwhile  initially scared me to death
attempt the impossible in order to improve your work
when you make a commitment to a relationship you invest your attention and energy in it more profoundly because you now experience ownership of that relationship
the men who have done big things are those who were not afraid to attempt big things who were not afraid to risk failure in order to gain success
security is not the meaning of my life
great opportunities are worth the risks
ill always push the envelope
to me the ultimate sin in life is to be boring
i dont play it safe
if the riskreward ratio is right you can make big money buying trouble
what isnt tried wont work
it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
security is mostly superstition
it does not exist in nature
all great reforms require one to dare a lot to win a little
competition can damage selfesteem create anxiety and lead to cheating and hurt feelings
but so can romantic love
i am willing to put myself through anything temporary pain or discomfort means nothing to me as long as i can see that the experience will take me to a new level
i am interested in the unknown and the only path to the unknown is through breaking barriers an often painful process
if you limit your actions in life to things that nobody can possibly find fault with you will not do much
those lose least who have least to lose
the ambitious climb high and perilous stairs and never care how to come down the desire of rising hath swallowed up their fear of a fall
he that would have fruit must climb the tree
love like a chicken salad or restaurant hash must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor
every noble acquisition is attended with its risks he who fears to encounter the one must not expect to obtain the other
providence has hidden a charm in difficult undertakings which is appreciated only by those who dare to grapple with them

cadillacs are down at the end of the bat
it is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks
you cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine
who dares nothing need hope for nothing
progress always involves risks
you cant steal second base and keep your foot on first
you cant catch trout with dry breeches
i dont think about risks much
i just do what i want to do
if you gotta go you gotta go
behold the turtle
he makes progress only when he sticks his neck out
nothing ventured nothing gained
dont be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated
you cant cross a chasm in two small steps
there is little place in the political scheme of things for an independent creative personality for a fighter
anyone who takes that role must pay a price
take calculated risks
that is quite different from being rash
valour lies just halfway between rashness and cowardice
i compensate for big risks by always doing my homework and being wellprepared
i can take on larger risks by reducing the overall risk
accept that all of us can be hurt that all of us canand surely will at timesfail
other vulnerabilities like being embarrassed or risking love can be terrifying too
i think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk
every man has the right to risk his own life in order to preserve it
has it ever been said that a man who throws himself out the window to escape a fire is guilty of suicide
courage is rarely reckless or foolish  courage usually involves a highly realistic estimate of the odds that must be faced
you can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake
it is the risk element which ensures security
risk brings out the ingenuity and resourcefulness which ensure success
entrepreneurs in accepting risk achieve security for all
in embracing change they ensure social and economic stability
those who cling to life die and those who defy death live
and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
danger can never by overcome without taking risks
the rewards go to the risktakers those who are willing to put their egos on the line and reach out to other people and to a richer fuller life for themselves
every minute of life i take a risk its part of the enjoyment
everything is sweetened by risk
my favorite thing is to go where i have never gone
the power of habit and the charm of novelty are the two adverse forces which explain the follies of mankind
the soul should always stand ajar ready to welcome the ecstatic experience
adventure is worthwhile in itself
we may by our excessive prudence squeeze out of the life we are guarding so anxiously all the adventurous quality that makes it worth living
a dreameryou knowits a mind that looks over the edges of things
i feel very adventurous
there are so many doors to be opened and im not afraid to look behind them
danger and delight grow on one stalk
life has no romance without risk
the moment somebody says this is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me
one can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar
prudence keeps life safe but does not often make it happy
between two evils i always picked the one i never tried before
life is either always a tightrope or a feather bed
give me the tightrope
the greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it
victories that are cheap are cheap
those only are worth having which come as the result of hard fighting
the greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it
people who are born eventempered placid and untroubledsecure from violent passions or temptations to evilthose who have never needed to struggle all night with the angel to emerge lame but victorious at dawn never become great saints
the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph
what we obtain too cheaply we esteem too lightly tis dearness only that gives everything its value
the fiery trials through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation
to conquer without risk is to triumph without glory
there could be no honor in a sure success but much might be wrested from a sure defeat
the follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didnt commit when he had the opportunity
there is no memory with less satisfaction than the memory of some temptation we resisted
the only things one never regrets are ones mistakes
the only things you regret are the things you dont do
the defense force inside of us wants us to be cautious to stay away from anything as intense as a new kind of action
its job is to protect us and it categorically avoids anything resembling danger
but its often wrong
for of all sad words of tongues or pen the saddest are these it might have been
calculation never made a hero
to play it safe is not to play
better hazard once than always be in fear
no one would have crossed the ocean if he could have gotten off the ship in the storm
nine times out of ten the best thing that can happen to a young man is to be tossed overboard and compelled to sink or swim
life is either a daring adventure or nothing
when something does not insist on being noticed when we arent grabbed by the collar or struck on the skull by a presence or an event we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude
there are those who have discovered that fear is death in life and have willingly risked physical death and loss of all that is considered valuable in order to live in freedom
i tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth and truth rewarded me
in danger there is great power
why not go out on a limb
isnt that where the fruit is
you might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward
defensive strategy never has produced ultimate victory
we stand now where two roads diverge
but unlike the roads in robert frosts familiar poem they are not equally fair
the road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed but at its end lies disaster
the other fork of the roadthe one less traveled byoffers our last our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth
to gain that which is worth having it may be necessary to lose everything else
we fail far more often by timidity than by overdaring
nothing can resist a will which will stake even existence upon its fulfillment
risk always brings its own rewards the exhilaration of breaking through of getting to the other side the relief of a conflict healed the clarity when a paradox dissolves
no guts no glory

act for yourself
face the truth
living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building your wings on the way down
we owe something to extravagance for thrift and adventure seldom go hand in hand
there was never a place for her in the ranks of the terrible slow army of the cautious
she ran ahead where there were no paths
i prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery
do not follow where the path may lead
go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
be wary of the man who urges an action in which he himself incurs no risk
creativity is inventing experimenting growing taking risks breaking rules making mistakes and having fun

dare to be naive

if a child is too keep alive his inborn sense of wonder  he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with him the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in
examine the personality of the mother who is the medium through which the primitive infant transforms herself into a socialized human being
that some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise
the best teachers of humanity are the lives of great men
as it is our nature to be more moved by hope than fear the example of one we see abundantly rewarded cheers and encourages us far more than the sight of many who have not been well treated disquiets us
keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions
small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great

children have more need of models than of critics
kill reverence and youve killed the hero in man
we deceive ourselves when we fancy that only weakness needs support
strength needs it far more
example has more followers than reason
example moves the world more than doctrine
example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other
example is not the main thing in influencing others
it is the only thing
we travel to learn and i have never been in any country where they did not do something better than we do it think some thoughts better than we think catch some inspiration from heights above our own
judgment can be acquired only by acute observation by actual experience in the school of life by ceaseless alertness to learn from others by study of the activities of men who have made notable marks by striving to analyze the everyday play of causes and effects by constant study of human nature
we need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives

our mothers and our grandmothers some of them moving to music not yet written
nothing is so infectious as example
there is a need for heroism in american life today

if  you cant be a good example then youll just have to be a horrible warning
if you want to be loved be lovable
man loves little and often woman much and rarely
the first sigh of love is the last of wisdom
love is an ocean of emotions entirely surrounded by expenses
if you would be loved love and be lovable
the magic of first love is our ignorance that it can ever end
immature love says i love you because i need you
mature love says i need you because i love you
if you want to be loved be lovable

every noble crown is and on earth will forever be a crown of thorns
the trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth

ay every inch a king
nations have passed away and left no traces and history gives the naked cause of it  one single simple reason in all cases they fell because their peoples were not fit
so in the libyan fable it is told that once an eagle stricken with a dart said when he saw the fashion of the shaft with our own feathers not by others hands are we now smitten
no man is demolished but by himself
what does not destroy me makes me strong
i never was ruined but twice  once when i lost a lawsuit and once when i gained one
all men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities
my downfall raises me to infinite heights
candour and generosity unless tempered by due moderation lead to ruin
italians come to ruin most generally in three ways  women gambling and farming
my family chose the slowest one
they say so is half a lie
i cannot tell how the truth may be i say the tale as twas said to me
what some invent the rest enlarge
god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
day of the lord as all our days should be

what makes old age so sad is not that our joys but our hopes cease
no sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than disbelief in great men

when we remember that we are all mad the mysteries disappear and life stands explained
madness is part of all of us all the time and it comes and goes waxes and wanes
a man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world
work and love  these are the basics waking life is a dream controlled
outside among your fellows among strangers you must preserve appearances a hundred things you cannot do but inside the terrible freedom
sanity is very rare every man almost and every woman has a dash of madness
mad bad and dangerous to know

the clever men at oxford know all there is to be knowed  but they none of them know as half as much as intelligent mr toad
research as the college student will come to know it is relatively thorough investigation primarily in libraries of a properly limited topic and presentation of the results of this investigation in a carefully organized and documented paper of some length
a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it
what is research but a blind date with knowledge
if i had read as much as other men i should have known no more than they
deepversed in books and shallow in himself
learning is the knowledge of that which none but the learned know
i would live to study not study to live

all science is either physics or stampcollecting
as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
he had read shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry
i am sorry to say there is too much point to the wise crack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours
if all the arts aspire to the condition of music all the sciences aspire to the condition of mathematics

in science all facts no matter how trivial or banal enjoy democratic equality
life exists in the universe only because the carbon atom possesses certain exceptional properties

most science is only high falutin nature studies
my advice is to look out for engineers  they begin with sewing machines and end up with the atomic bomb

scientific discovery consists in the interpretation for our own convenience of a system of existence which has been made with no eye to our convenience at all
the means by which we live have outdistanced the ends for which we live
our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power
we have guided missiles and misguided men
the scientific theory i like best is that the rings of saturn are composed entirely of lost airline luggage
the simplest schoolboy is now familiar with truths for which archimedes would have sacrificed his life
wetenschap is wat wetenschappers doen  science is what scientists do
technology  the knack of so arranging the world that we dont have to experience it
the great tragedy of science the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact
technology means the systematic application of scientific or other organized knowledge to practical tasks
whenever science makes a discovery the devil grabs it while the angels are debating the best way to use it
science cannot stop while ethics catches up  and nobody should expect scientists to do all the thinking for the country
science must constantly be reminded that her purposes are not the only purposes and that the order of uniform causation which she has use for and is therefore right in postulating may be enveloped in a wider order on which she has no claim at all
science is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our senseexperience correspond to a logically uniform system of thought
though many have tried no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science which can do so much cannot decide what it ought to do
it may be bizarre but in my opinion science offers a sure path to god and religion
as both the mercury and apollo programs have shown our science and technology are so powerful that if an intense effort is made we can do almost anything we want in say ten years  provided we are not in conflict with the laws of nature

the first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts
computers can figure out all kinds of problems except the things in the world that just dont add up

there is more than a mere suspicion that the scientist who comes to ask metaphysical questions and turns away from metaphysical answers may be afraid of those answers
in science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world not to the man to whom the idea first occurs

pollution is nothing but resources were not harvesting
medieval technology
the middle ages invented among other things the crank the horse collar eyeglasses the flying buttress the stirrup the windmill the wheelbarrow printing firearms paper the canal lock the compass the rudder the mechanical clock the spinning wheel and the treadle
the best defence against the atom bomb is not to be there when it goes off
a few observations and much reasoning lead to error many observations and a little reasoning to truth

every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination
steam is no stronger now than it was a hundred years ago but it is put to better use
science and art belong to the whole world and before them vanish the barriers of nationality
science is simply common sense at its best  that is rigidly accurate in observation and merciless to fallacy in logic

give me but one hour of scotland let me see it ere i die
o caledonia
stern and wild meet nurse for a poetic child
land of brown heath and shaggy wood land of the mountain and the flood land of my sires
what mortal hand can eer untie the filial band that knits me to thy rugged strand
a glory gilds the sacred page majestic like the sun it gives a light to every age it gives but borrows none
thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
we search the world for truth we cull the good the pure the beautiful from all old flower fields of the soul and weary seekers of the best we come back laden from our quest to find that all the sages said is in the book our mothers read
madam de stael pronounced architecture to be frozen music so is statuary crystalized spirituality

and i would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that arise in me
autumn to winter winter into spring
spring into summer summer into fall   so rolls the changing year and so we change motion so swift we know not that we move
spring is a virgin summer a mother autumn a widow and winter a stepmother
there is a skeleton in every house
a man can hide all things excepting twain   that he is drunk and that he is in love
the secret things belong unto the lord our god
nothing is secret which shall not be made manifest
if you would wish another to keep your secret first keep it yourself
what is told in the ear of a man is often heard 100 miles away
two things a man cannot hide that he is drunk and that he is in love
nothing is so burdensome as a secret
it is a secret in the oxford sense
you may tell it to only one person at a time
i know thats a secret for its whispered everywhere
all the knowledge i possess everyone else can acquire but my heart is all my own
shy and unready men are great betrayers of secrets for there are few wants more urgent for the moment than the want of something to say
in the mind and nature of a man a secret is an ugly thing like a hidden physical defect
be secret and exult because of all things known that is most difficult
if you wish to preserve your secret wrap it up in frankness
where secrecy reigns carelessness and ignorance delight to hide  skill loves the light
whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
even in your thought do not curse the king nor in your bedchamber curse the rich for a bird of the air will carry your voice or some winged creature tell the matter
security is mostly superstition
it does not exist in nature

avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure
the fearful are caught as often as the bold
security is a false god begin making sacrifices to it and you are lost
god himself is not secure having given man dominion over his works
the man who looks for security even in the mind is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble
never think youve seen the last of anything
if you want total security go to prison
there youre fed clothed given medical care and so on
the only thing lacking  is freedom
life is not orderly
no matter how we try to make life so right in the middle of it we die lose a leg fall in love drop a jar of applesauce
truly nothing is to be expected but the unexpected
happiness greatness pridenothing is secure nothing keeps
there is no security no assurance that because we wrote something good two months ago we will do it again
actually every time we begin we wonder how we ever did it before
there is no security on this earth
only opportunity
there is no way to take the danger out of human relationships
it is the risk element which ensures security
risk brings out the ingenuity and resourcefulness which insure success
the way to be safe is never to be secure
we are never more in danger than when we think ourselves most secure nor in reality more secure than when we seem to be most in danger
it is when we all play safe that we create a world of utmost insecurity
to keep oneself safe does not mean to bury oneself
safety first has been the motto of the human race for half a million years but it has never been the motto of leaders
if money is your hope for independence you will never have it
the only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge experience and ability
our greatest illusion is reliance upon the security and permanence of material possessions
we must search for some other coin
the only peace the only security is in fulfillment
solvency is entirely a matter of temperament not of income
security depends not so much upon how much you have as upon how much you can do without
security can only be achieved through constant change through discarding old ideas that have outlived their usefulness and adapting others to current facts
truth is the only safe ground to stand upon
only in growth reform and change paradoxically enough is true security to be found
security is not the absence of danger but the presence of god no matter what the danger
im in love with the potential of miracles
for me the safest place is out on a limb
mans security comes from within himself
you are all you will ever have for certain
no one can builu her security upon the nobleness of another person
your real security is yourself
you know you can do it and they cant ever take that away from you
only those means of security are good are certain are lasting that depend on yourself and your own vigor
uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life
security is an insipid thing
freedom works
to be on the alert is to live to be lulled into security is to die
prudence keeps life safe but does not often make it happy
whatever course you have chosen for yourself it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving  if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre
security is a kind of death
without danger we cannot get beyond danger each one of us requires the spur of insecurity to force us to do our best
nerves provide me with energy

its when i dont have them when i feel at ease that i get worried
protection and security are only valuable if they do not cramp life excessively
too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity they seem more afraid of life than of death
the one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fearfear of the unknown the complex the inexplicable
what he wants beyond everything else is safety
we spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it
be like the bird that passing on her flight awhile on boughs too slight feels them give way beneath her and yet sings knowing that she hath wings
we hear of a silent generation more concerned with security than integrity with conforming than performing with imitating than creating
a man cannot be comfortable without his own approval
an old man concludeth from his knowing mankind that they know him too and that maketh him very wary
a sick man that gets talking about himself a woman that gets talking about her baby and an author that begins reading out of his own book never know when to stop
each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life
it is not something discovered it is something moulded
egotism the art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see
every one is bound to bear patiently the results of his own example
he who is in love with himself has at least this advantage he wont encounter many rivals
if you cant bite dont show your teeth
know him know me
man who man would be must rule the empire of himself
no man does anything from a single motive
nobody can honestly think of himself as a strong character because however successful he may be in overcoming them he is necessarily aware of the doubts and temptations that accompany every important choice
we carry with us the wonders we seek without us
what the collective age wants allows and approves is the perpetual holiday from the self
when a man is wrapped up in himself he makes a pretty small package
whos not sat tense before his own hearts curtain
if a man really knew himself he would utterly despise the ignorant notions others might form on a subject in which he had such matchless opportunities for observation
with every physical pain my moral fibre unravels a little
i have never seen a greater monster or miracle in the world than myself
we are all serving a life sentence in the dungeon of self
one may understand the cosmos but never the ego the self is more distant than any star
we judge ourselves by our motives and others by their actions
there is nothing noble about being superior to some other man
the true nobility is in being superior to your previous self
selfconfidence is the first requisite to great undertakings
never to talk of oneself is a form of hypocrisy
goethe said there would be little left of him if you were to discard what he owed to others
be yourself
who else is better qualified
i dont think anyone is free  one creates ones own prison
i am i plus my circumstances
i think somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision
there is nothing will kill a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself
i am as bad as the worst but thank god i am as good as the best
a man can stand a lot as long as he can stand himself
he can live without hope without friends without books even without music as long as he can listen to his own thoughts
if you really do put a small value upon yourself rest assured that the world will not raise your price
if i am not for myself who will be
the greatest success is successful selfacceptance
compassion for myself is the most powerful healer of them all
selfrespect is the root of discipline the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself
if you know nothing be pleased to know nothing
i am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals
i have within me the great pope self
the happy man is he who knows his limitations yet bows to no false gods
from without no wonderful effect is wrought within ourselves unless some interior responding wonder meets it
nobody knows whats in him until he tries to pull it out
if theres nothing or very little the shock can kill a man
blessed are they who heal us of selfdespisings
of all services which can be done to man i know of none more precious
when three people call you an ass put on a bridle
a complete life may be one ending in so full an identification with the notself that there is no self left to die
a show of envy is an insult to oneself
maturity consists of no longer being taken in by oneself
our own interests are still an exquisite means for dazzling our eyes agreeably
to penetrate ones being one must go armed to the teeth
men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
selfreverence selfknowledge selfcontrol  these three alone lead to sovereign power
there are limits to selfindulgence none to selfrestraint
integrity simply means a willingness not to violate ones identity
the important thing is not what they think of me it is what i think of them
i think dostoevsky was right that every human being must have a point at which he stands against the culture where he says this is me and the damned world can go to hell
o wad some powr the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us
it wad frae money a blunder free us and foolish notion
selfrespecting people do not care to peep at their reflections in unexpected mirrors or to see themselves as others see them
selfcommand is the main elegance
no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
i am better than my reputation
do i contradict myself
very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes
be thine own palace or the worlds thy jail
do not make yourself so big
you are not so small
individualism is rather like innocence there must be something unconscious about it

such to me is the new image of aging growth in self and service for all mankind
the older i get the greater power i seem to have to help the world i am like a snowballthe further i am rolled the more i gain
the real evidence of growing older is that things level off in importance
it is sad to grow old but nice to ripen
oh yes
id do it all again the spirit is willing yet i feel the same desire to do the work but the flesh is weak
its too bad that our bodies wear out while our interests are just as strong as ever
im not interested in age
people who tell me their age are silly
youre as old as you feel
it is sad to grow old but nice to ripen
maturity is coming to terms with that other part of yourself
i believe the true function of age is memory
im recording as fast as i can
a womans always younger than a man of equal years
it is often the case with finer natures that when the fire of the spirit dies out with increasing age the power of the intellect is unaltered or increased
im like old wine
they dont bring me out very often but im well preserved
the great thing about getting older is that you dont lose all the other ages youve been

age is totally unimportant
the years are really irrelevant
its how you cope with them
we are always the same age inside

so much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls why doesnt somebody wake up to the beauty of old women
old age is that night of life as night is the old age of day
still night is full of magnificence and for many it is more brilliant than the day
in youth we learn in age we understand
change excites me
i am fifty years old
its when the mind catches up with the body
dont buy the garbage that youre over the hill at fifty
this country makes such a big thing about age particularly if youre a woman
what i think is relevant is your experience what you have to offer
i hope people will recognize that and keep going
i refuse to admit that i am more than fiftytwo even if that does make my sons illegitimate
i used to dread getting older because i thought i would not be able to do all the things i wanted to do but now that i am older i find that i dont want to do them

nothing can be done without hope and confidence
confidence imparts a wonderful inspiration to its possessor

immense power is acquired by assuring yourself in your secret reveries that you were born to control affairs

i gain a sense of mastery and assurance
i feel good about myself
then i can feel good about others
nothing is a greater impediment to being on good terms with others than being ill at ease with yourself
measure yourself by your best moments not by your worst
we are too prone to judge ourselves by our moments of despondency and depression

englishmen never will be slaves they are free to do whatever the government and public opinion allow them to do
the feeling of sleepiness when you are not in bed and cant get there is the meanest feeling in the world
did anyone ever have a boring dream
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep
sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care the death of each days life sore labours bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast
over my slumber your loving watch keep   rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep
fatigue is the best pillow
sleep is the best cure for waking troubles
one hours sleep before midnight is worth three after
soft closer of our eyes
low murmur of tender lullabies
sleep rest of nature o sleep most gentle of the divinities peace of the soul thou at whose presence care disappears who soothest hearts wearied with daily employments and makest them strong again for labour
i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only makest me dwell in safety
he giveth his beloved sleep
i never sleep comfortably except when i am at sermon or when i pray to god
to all to each a fair goodnight and pleasing dreams and slumbers light
she slept the sleep of the just
to sleep
perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause
o sleep o gentle sleep natures soft nurse
hush my dear lie still and slumber
holy angels guard they bed
heavenly blessings without number gently falling on thy head
ive had a lot of experience with people smarter than i am
the smartest thing i ever said was help me
a smart husband buys his wife very fine china so she wont trust him to wash it
after pleasant scratching comes unpleasant smarting
i am not the smartest or most talented person in the world but i succeeded because i keep going and going and going
cats are smarter than dogs
you cant get eight cats to pull a sled through snow

smiles form the channels of a future tear
tis easy enough to be pleasant when life flows along like a song but the man worth while is the one who will smile when everything goes dead wrong
whats the use of worrying
it never was worth while so pack up your troubles in your old kitbag and smile smile smile
its full of worth and goodness too with manly kindness blent its worth a million dollars and it doesnt cost a cent
who can refute a sneer
it is just as hard to do your duty when men are sneering at you as when they are shooting at you
the public has a taste for supping with the great
laughter would be bereaved if snobbery died
the true definition of a snob is one who craves for what separates men rather than for what unites them
no place in england where everyone can go is considered respectable
snobs talk as if they had begotten their ancestors
a highbrow is a person educated beyond his intelligence
all the people like us are we and everyone else is they
the true snob never rests there is always a higher goal to attain and there are by the same token always more and more people to look down upon
year of snow fruit will grow
but where are the snows of yesteryear
these monstrous views these venomous teachings
all socialism involves slavery
every generation is a secret society and has incommunicable enthusiasm tastes and interests which are a mystery both to its predecessor and to posterity
fools take to themselves the respect that is given to their office
aesop it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
society is commonly too cheap
we meet at very short intervals not having had time to acquire any new value for each other
we meet at meals three times a day and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are
somerset house in london where at one time english vital statistics were kept  birth marriage and death records  was known as the egg factory where they hatch em match em and dispatch em
socialism must come down from the brain and reach the heart
society can only exist on the basis that there is some amount of polished lying and that no one says exactly what he thinks
the cocktail party  as the name itself indicates  was originally invented by dogs
they are simply bottomsniffings raised to the rank of formal ceremonies
two people can form a community by excluding a third
the world has narrowed to a neighbourhood before it has broadened to a brotherhood
there are only two families in the world as a grandmother of mine used to say the haves and the havenots
what is a communist
one who hath yearnings for equal division of unequal earnings
society is composed of two great classes those who have more dinners than appetite and those who have more appetite than dinners
the complacent the selfindulgent the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history
society is now one polished horde formed of two mighty tribes the bores and the bored
society dead or alive can have no charm without intimacy and no intimacy without an interest in trifles
to be social is to be forgiving
if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich
the difference between our decadence and the russians is that while theirs is brutal ours is apathetic
the cocktail party  a device for paying off obligations to people you dont want to invite to dinner
vigorous societies harbour a certain extravagance of objectives
in any assembly the simplest way to stop the transacting of business and split the ranks is to appeal to a principle
tolerably early in life i discovered that one of the unpardonable sins in the eyes of most people is for a man to go about unlabeled
the world regards such a person as the police do an unmuzzled dog
twenty per cent of the people in volunteer groups do ninety per cent of the work
nothing is so dangerous as being too modern one is apt to grow oldfashioned quite suddenly
gentleman one who never hurts anyones feelings unintentionally
etiquette means behaving yourself a little better than is absolutely essential
the best things and best people rise out of their separateness im against a homogenized society because i want the cream to rise
there are four varieties in society the lovers the ambitious observers and fools
the fools are the happiest
whatever people may say the fastidious formal manner of the upper classes is preferable to the slovenly easygoing behaviour of the common middle class
in moments of crisis the former know how to act the latter become uncouth brutes
the classes that wash most are those that work least
necessity is the constant scourge of the lower classes ennui of the higher ones
society my dear is like salt water good to swim in but hard to swallow
only a few human beings should grow to the square mile they are commonly planted too close
tis the final conflict
let each stand in his place
the international working class shall be the human race
every society honours its live conformists and its dead troublemakers
in order to stand well in the eyes of the community it is necessary to come up to a certain somewhat indefinite conventional standard of wealth
class is an aura of confidence that is being sure without being cocky
class has nothing to do with money
class never runs scared
it is selfdiscipline and selfknowledge
its the surefootedness that comes with having proved you can meet life
i respect kindness in human beings first of all and kindness to animals
i dont respect the law i have a total irreverance for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer the beer stronger the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer
every man is a consumer and ought to be a producer
these families you know are our upper crust not upper ten thousand
he might have proved a useful adjunct if not an ornament to society
man is a social animal
it is impossible in our condition of society not to be sometimes a snob
to get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people amuse people or shock people
the king of france with twenty thousand men went up the hill and then came down again the king of spain with twenty thousand more climbed the same hill the french had climbed before
god and a soldier all people adore in time of war but not before and when war is over and all things are righted god is neglected and an old soldier slighted
home they brought her warrior dead
how sleep the brave who sink to rest
by all their countrys wishes blest
we are coming father abraham three hundred thousand more
every citizen should be a soldier
this was the case with the greeks and romans and must be that of every free state
for its tommy this an tommy that and chuck im out the brute
but its savior of is country when the guns begin to shoot
it is not the guns or armament or the money they can pay its the close cooperation that makes them win the day
it is not the individual or the army as a whole but the everlastin teamwork of every bloomin soul
a soldier is an anachronism of which we must get rid
but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground
the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
the muffled drums sad roll has beat the soldiers last tattoo no more on lifes parade shall meet the brave and fallen few
on fames eternal campingground their silent tents are spread and glory guards with solemn round the bivouac of the dead
i want to see you shoot the way you shout
there are three things a man must do alone
be born die and testify
solitary trees if they grow at all grow strong
we never touch but at points
i was never less alone than when by myself
in the world a man lives in his own age in solitude in all ages
i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude
if from society we learn to live tis solitude should teach us how to die it hath no flatterers
solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character
one can acquire everything in solitude but character
solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition
man is the only being who knows he is alone
its a rather pleasant experience to be alone in a bank at night
were all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins for life
to dare to live alone is the rarest courage since there are many who had rather meet their bitterest enemy in the field than their own hearts in their closet
one of the greatest necessities in america is to discover creative solitude
secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster
night when words fade and things come alive when the destructive analysis of day is done and all that is truly important becomes whole and sound again
when man reassembles his fragmentary self and grows with the calm of a tree
in solitude when we are least alone
we enter the world alone we leave it alone
far from the madding crowds ignoble strife
alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea
i praise the frenchman his remark was shrewd   how sweet how passing sweet is solitude
but grant me still a friend in my retreat whom i may whisper  solitude is sweet
the strongest man is the one who stands most alone
solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character
the thoughtful soul to solitude retires
i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude
swans sing before they die  twere no bad thing should certain persons die before they sing
a song will outlive all sermons in the memory
the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy
and so make life death and that vast forever one grand sweet song
god sent his singers upon earth with songs of sadness and of mirth that they might touch the hearts of men and bring them back to heaven again
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought
whats gone and whats past help should be past grief
about suffering they were never wrong the old masters how well they understood its human position how it takes place while someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along
excessive sorrow laughs
excessive joy weeps
hes simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed
one cannot weep for the entire world
it is beyond human strength
one must choose
should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings
sorrow makes us all children again
there are some men above grief and some men below it
unhurt people are not much good in the world
in extreme youth in our most humiliating sorrow we think we are alone
when we are older we find that others have suffered too
the deeper the sorrow the less tongue it hath
when sorrows come they come not as single spies but in battalions
men who are unhappy like men who sleep badly are always proud of the fact
what man is there that does not laboriously though all unconsciously himself fashion the sorrow that is to be the pivot of his life
only onefourth of the sorrow in each mans life is caused by outside uncontrollable elements the rest is selfimposed by failing to analyze and act with calmness
there is something pleasurable in calm remembrance of a past sorrow
the poor and the busy have no leisure for sentimental sorrow
while grief is fresh every attempt to divert it only irritates
no one can keep his griefs in their prime they use themselves up
sorrow is a fruit god does not allow it to grow on a branch that is too weak to bear it
there are few sorrows however poignant in which a good income is of no avail
the busy have no time for tears
i walked a mile with sorrow and neer a word said she but oh the things i learned from her when sorrow walked with me
every noble crown is and on earth will ever be a crown of thorns
all sorrows are bearable if there is bread
hang sorrow carell kill a cat
to sorrow i bade goodmorrow and thought to leave her far away behind but cheerly cheerly she loves me dearly she is so constant to me and so kind
sorrows are like thunderclouds  in the distance they look black over our heads scarcely gray
the deeper the sorrow the less tongue hath it
joy was a flame in me too steady to destroy
lithe as a bending reed loving the storm that sways her   i found more joy in sorrow than you could find in joy
more in sorrow than in anger
there can be no rainbow without a cloud and a storm
john browns body lies a mouldring in the grave his soul goes marching on
the one thing in the world of value is the active soul
it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishments the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul
soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry
what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
i sent my soul through the invisible some letter of that afterlife to spell and by and by my soul returned to me and answered i myself am heavn and hell
the iron entered into his soul
self is the only prison that can ever bind the soul
a charge to keep i have a god to glorify a neverdying soul to save and fit it for the sky
i loafe and invite my soul i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass
the windows of my soul i throw wide open to the sun
the empty vessel makes the greatest sound
hark
from the tombs a doleful sound
a man does not know what he is saying until he knows what he is not saying
even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth
he rose without a friend and sat down without an enemy
language most shows a man speak that i may see thee
little said is soon amended
there is always time to add a word never to withdraw one
none love to speak so much when the mood of speaking comes as they who are naturally taciturn
nothing is so unbelievable that oratory cannot make it acceptable
speak clearly if you speak at all carve every word before you let it fall
the relationship of the toastmaster to the speaker should be the same as that of the fan to the fan dancer
it should call attention to the subject without making any particular effort to cover it
though old the thought and oft exprest tis his at last who says it best
to know how to say what others only know how to think is what makes men poets or sages and to dare to say what others only dare to think makes men martyrs or reformers or both
whatever is well said by another is mine
winston churchill has devoted the best years of his life to preparing his impromptu speeches
would you persuade speak of interest not of reason
it is terrible to speak well and be wrong
all the great speakers were bad speakers at first
if the announcer can produce the impression that he is a gentleman he may pronounce as he pleases
a dull speaker like a plain woman is credited with all the virtues for we charitably suppose that a surface so unattractive must be compensated by interior blessings
once you get people laughing theyre listening and you can tell them almost anything
speak what you think today in words as hard as cannon balls and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict everything you said today
when a man gets talking about himself he seldom fails to be eloquent and often reaches the sublime
in an easy cause any man may be eloquent
the object of oratory alone is not truth but persuasion
if no thought your mind does visit make your speech not too explicit
oratory the art of making deep noises from the chest sound like important messages from the brain
the glittering generalities of the speaker have left an impression more delightful than permanent
say what you have to say and the first time you come to a sentence with a grammatical ending  sit down
first learn the meaning of what you say and then speak
when a man is asked to make a speech the first thing he has to decide is what to say
ive never thought my speeches were too long ive rather enjoyed them
blessed is the man who having nothing to say abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact
look wise say nothing and grunt
speech was given to conceal thought
i have learnt a good deal from my own talk
speech is the small change of silence
if you dont say anything you wont be called on to repeat it
in maine we have a saying that theres no point in speaking unless you can improve on silence
if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever
use a piledriver
hit the point once
then come back and hit it again
then hit it a third time  a tremendous whack
he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument
that which is repeated too often becomes insipid and tedious
let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace
his speech was a fine sample on the whole of rhetoric which the learnd call rigmarole
speech is silvern silence is golden
he mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone
a sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity
i will sit down now but the time will come when you will hear me
the harebrained chatter of irresponsible frivolity
for that man is detested by me as the gates of hell whose outward words conceal his inmost thoughts
his speech flowed from his tongue sweeter than honey
for gods sake let us freely hear both sides
every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth and every other man has a right to knock him down for it
woe unto you when all men shall speak well of vou
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
if you your lips would keep from slips five things observe with care to whom you speak of whom you speak and how and when and where
rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men
it is a tiresome way of speaking when you should despatch the business to beat about the bush
let no one be willing to speak ill of the absent
a soft answer turneth away wrath
he replies nothing but monosyllables
i believe he would make three bites of a cherry
speak after the manner of men
speech is the index of the mind
i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city
when i use the word spirituality i dont necessarily mean religion i mean whatever it is that helps you feel connected to something that is larger than yourself
the spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it
the fact that i can plant a seed and it becomes a flower share a bit of knowledge and it becomes anothers smile at someone and receive a smile in return are to me continual spiritual exercises
faith is the evidence of things not seen
they understand but little who understand only what can be explained
some things have to be believed to be seen
faith is like electricity
you cant see it but you can see the light
faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light
live your beliefs and you can turn the world around
if you cant have faith in what is held up to you for faith you must find things to believe in yourself for life without faith in something is too narrow a space to live
i am one of those who would rather sink with faith than swim without it
if a blade of grass can grow in a concrete walk and a fig tree in the side of a mountain cliff a human being empowered with an invincible faith can survive all odds the world can throw against his tortured soul
faith is not knowledge of what the mystery of the universe is but the conviction that there is a mystery and that it is greater than us
faith is our direct link to universal wisdom reminding us that we know more than we have heard or read or studied that we have only to look listen and trust the love and wisdom of the universal spirit working through us all
believe in something larger than yourself
faith is knowing there is an ocean because you have seen a brook
faith is above all openness an act of trust in the unknown
faith is believing before receiving
faith is not being sure where youre going but going anyway
faith is to believe what we do not see the reward of this faith is to see what we believe
you can do very little with faith but you can do nothing without it
all things are possible to him who believes
faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark
do not have your concert first and tune your instruments afterwards
begin the day with god
all my life i have risen regularly at four oclock and have gone into the woods and talked to god
there he gives me my orders for the day
the strength of a man consists in finding out the way in which god is going and going in that way too
god gives us always strength enough and sense enough for everything he wants us to do
god gave burdens also shoulders
there is literally nothing that i ever asked to do that i asked the blessed creator to help me to do that i have not been able to accomplish
here on earth gods work must surely be our own
god can dream a bigger dream for you than you can dream for yourself and your role on earth is to attach yourself to that divine force and let yourself be released to it
we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us
its not just in some of us its in everyone
i believe god is managing affairs and that he doesnt need any advice from me
with god in charge i believe everything will work out for the best in the end
in a world filled with causes for worry and anxiety


we need the peace of god standing guard over our hearts and minds
remember that everything has gods fingerprints on it
there is not a flower that opens not a seed that falls into the ground and not an ear of wheat that nods on the end of its stalk in the wind that does not preach and proclaim the greatness and the mercy of god to the whole world
millions of angels are at gods command
the holy spirit


wants to flow through us and realize all these wonderful possibilities in the world  if we only open ourselves and allow it to happen
do you not know that you are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells within you
god does not ask your ability or your inability
he asks only your availability
when you have succeeded in enshrining god within your heart you will see him everywhere
god dwells wherever man lets him in
god is love
god loves you
god doesnt want anyone to be hungry and oppressed
he just puts his big arms around everybody and hugs them up against himself
god loves us the way we are but he loves us too much to leave us that way
the best minister is the human heart the best teacher is time the best book is the world the best friend is god
i love god and when you get to know him you find hes a livin doll
i dont believe in god
just try getting a plumber on the weekend
god comes at last when we think he is farthest off
god gave you a gift of 86400 seconds today
have you used one to say thank you
if you begin to live life looking for the god that is all around you every moment becomes a prayer
prayer may not change things for you but it for sure changes you for things
get down on your knees and thank god you are on your feet
time spent on the knees in prayer will do more to remedy heart strain and nerve worry than anything else
you pray in your distress and in your need would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance
i never went to bed in my life and i never ate a meal in my life without saying a prayer
i know my prayers have been answered thousands of times and i know that i never said a prayer in my life without something good coming of it
god answers all our prayers
sometimes the answer is yes
sometimes the answer is no
sometimes the answer is youve got to be kidding
why is it when we talk to god we are said to be praying and when god talks to us were said to be schizophrenic
a grandfather was walking through his yard when he heard his granddaughter repeating the alphabet in a tone of voice that sounded like a prayer
he asked her what she was doing
the little girl explained im praying but i cant think of exactly the right words so im just saying all the letters and god will put them together for me because he knows what im thinking
when you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life
its important to be heroic ambitious productive efficient creative and progressive but these qualities dont necessarily nurture the soul
the soul has different concerns of equal value downtime for reflection conversation and reverie beauty that is captivating and pleasuring relatedness to the environs and to people and any animals rhythm of rest and activity
excite the soul and the weather and the town and your condition in the world all disappear the world itself loses its solidity nothing remains but the soul and the divine presence in which it lives
the soul is awakened through service
souls are made of dawnstuff and starshine
i was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam i looked into the soul of the boy next to me
nobody grows old by merely living a number of years
people grow old only by deserting their ideals
years wrinkle the face but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul
the purpose of life on earth is that the soul should grow   so growl by doing what is right
the soul  is audible not visible
soul appears when we make room for it
football combines the two worst features of american life
it is violence punctuated by committee meetings
great sport begins at a point where it has ceased to be healthy
skate to where the puck is going and not to where its been
i hate all sports as rabidly as a person who likes sports hates common sense
you cant think and hit at the same time
pro football is like nuclear warfare
there are no winners only survivors
horses and jockeys mature earlier than people  which is why horses are admitted to race tracks at the age of two and jockeys before they are old enough to shave
jogging is very beneficial
its good for your legs and your feet
its also very good for the ground
it makes it feel needed
it you watch a game its fun
if you play it its recreation
if you work at it its golf
winning can be defined as the science of being totally prepared
running for money doesnt make you run fast
it makes you run first
when you win nothing hurts
lets win this one for the gipper
sports allow men to build up situations of emergency
what he then demands of himself is unnecessary achievement  and unnecessary sacrifice
he artificially creates the tension that he has been spared by affluent society
it is in games that many men discover their paradise
international sport is war without shooting
fatigue makes cowards of us all
sports do not build character
they reveal it
every time you win youre reborn when you lose you die a little
becoming number one is easier than remaining number one
if you arent fired with enthusiasm youll be fired with enthusiasm
sport is one area where no participant is worried about anothers race religion or wealth and where the only concern is have you come to play
behind every tennis player there is another tennis player
catching a fly ball is a pleasure but knowing what to do with it is a business
trying to get a fast ball past hank aaron is like trying to get the sun past a rooster
golf is a good walk spoiled
a sportsman is a man who every now and then simply has to get out and kill something
not that hes cruel
he wouldnt hurt a fly
its not big enough
walking is the best possible exercise
habituate yourself to walk very far
hockey captures the essence of the canadian experience in the new world
in a land so inescapably and inhospitably cold hockey is the dance of life and an affirmation that despite the deathly chill of winter we are alive
the game isnt over until its over
the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong  but thats the way to bet
sport begets tumultuous strife and wrath and wrath begets fierce quarrels and war to the death
citius altius fortius
swifter higher stronger
well god is certainly getting an earful tonight
going to bed with a woman never hurt a ball player
its staying up all night looking for them that does you in
knute rockne liked bad losers
he said good losers lose too often
ninety per cent of this game is halfmental
i have never been able to understand why pigeonshooting at hurlingham should be refined and polite while a ratkilling match in whitechapel is low
when i play with my cat who knows whether i do not make her more sport than she makes me
if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work
when a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport wlien the tiger wants to murder him he calls it ferocity
our team was surprisingly consistent this year
we closed with a sevenseven record
we lost seven at home and seven on the road
all pro athletes are bilingual
they speak english and profanity
i want you all to line up in alphabetical order according to your size
slumps in life are like soft beds
theyre easy to get into and hard to get out of
they xrayed my head and found nothing
go jogging
and get hit by a meteor
when i see joggers go by i shout jim fixx is dead
fats domino lives
everywhere is walking distance if you have the time
counting both times i cheated this week i won at solitaire twice
you know youre getting old when you start watching golf on tv and enjoying it
as a woman i resent the fact that in golf if i have the highest score im the loser
he who has the fastest cart never has a bad lie
my best score is 103 but ive only been playing for fifteen years
its not that i really cheat at golf
i play for my health and a low score makes me feel better
i play in the low eighties
if its any hotter than that i wont play
i asked my instructor how i could cut ten strokes off my score
he told me to quit on hole 17
i get confused with all the rules in golf
lets say youre playing in la and your ball lands on a dead body
is your relief one or two club lengths
my golf has really improved even though my score hasnt
im missing the ball much closer now
gimme an agreement between two losers who cant putt
the reason the pro tells you to keep your head down is so you cant see him laughing
golf is not a matter of life or death
it is much more important than that
player can i reach it with a five iron
caddie eventually

a schoolboys tale the wonder of an hour
tush
these are trifles and mere old wives tales
what so tedious as a twicetold tale
i cannot tell how the truth may be i say the tale as twas said to me
a tale never loses in the telling
i will a round unvarnishd tale deliver
all our talents increase in the using and every faculty both good and bad strengthens by exercise
conciseness is the sister of talent
genius does what it must and talent does what it can
in this world people have to pay an extortionate price for any exceptional gift whatever
there is no substitute for talent
industry and all the virtures are of no avail
talent is always conscious of its own abundance and does not object to sharing
the luck of having talent is not enough one must also have a talent for luck
a talent somewhat above mediocrity shrewd and not too sensitive is more likely to rise in the world than genius which is apt to be perturbable and to wear itself out before fruition
great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity
they hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off
everyone has a talent
what is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark places where it leads
the crowning blessing of life  to be born with a bias to some pursuit
concealed talent brings no reputation
the world is always ready to receive talent with open arms
the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes  and ships  and sealingwax   of cabbages  and kings   and why the sea is boiling hot   and whether pigs have wings
but far more numerous was the herd of stfch who think too little and who talk too much
talk is cheap
in much of your talking thinking is half murdered
they never taste who always drink they always talk who never think
talkers are no good doers
in general those who nothing have to say contrive to spend the longest time in doing it
those who have few things to attend to are great babblers for the less men think the more they talk
he who talks too much commits a sin
the secret of being tiresome is in telling everything
everyone carries his own inchrule of taste and amuses himself by applying it triumphantly wherever he travels
talking is like playing on the harp there is as much in laying the hand on the strings to stop their vibrations as in twanging them to bring out their music
good taste is the first refuge of the noncreative
it is the last ditch stand of the artist
it is good taste and good taste alone that possesses the power to sterilize and is always the first handicap to any creative functioning
taste is the feminine of genius
taste is the enemy of creativeness
have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful
style is a simple way of saying complicated things
fashion exists for women with no taste etiquette for people with no breeding
people care more about being thought to have good taste than about being thought either good clever or amiable
we all have some taste or other of too ancient a date to admit of our remembering that it was an acquired one
good taste and humour are a contradiction in terms like a chaste whore
taste cannot be controlled by law
one of the surest signs of the philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down
one mans poison ivy is another mans spinach
taste is nothing but a delicate good sense
everyone to his taste
my tastes are aristocratic my actions democratic
a mans palate can in time become accustomed to anything
good taste is the flower of good sense
the finer impulse of our nature
every man as he loveth quoth the good man when he kissed the cow
the eiffel tower is the empire state building after taxes
the power to tax involves the power to destroy
the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to get the most feathers with the least hissing
the point to remember is that what the government gives it must first take away
next to being shot at and missed nothing is quite as satisfying as an income tax refund
the income tax has made more liars out of the american people than golf has
even when you make a tax form out on the level you dont know when its through if you are a crook or a martyr
governments last as long as the undertaxed can defend themselves against the overtaxed
there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed


and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city
the promises of yesterday are the taxes of today
the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing
death and taxes are inevitable
first he wrought and afterwards he taught
give a man a fish and you feed him for a day
teach man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
the school teacher is certainly underpaid as a child minder but ludicrously overpaid as an educator
there is no crisis to which academics will not respond with a seminar
a teacher affects eternity he can never tell where his influence stops
it would be a great advantage to some schoolmasters if they would steal two hours a day from their pupils and give their own minds the benefit of the robbery
if the student fails to learn the teacher fails to teach
to teach is to learn twice
the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive hindrance to those who desire to learn
teaching is not a lost art but the regard for it is a lost tradition
a highschool teacher after all is a person deputized by the rest of us to explain to the young what sort of world they are living in and to defend if possible the part their elders are playing in it
he who can does
he who cant teaches
nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
i hear and i forget
i see and i remember
i do and i understand
the secret of teaching is to appear to have known all your life what you learned this afternoon
no man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge
the first duty of a lecturer to hand you after an hours discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever
we teach what we need to learn and write what we need to know
you cannot teach old dogs new tricks
a man should first direct himself in the way he should go
only then should he instruct others
you cannot teach a man anything you can only help him to find it within himself
a teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron
speak to the earth and it shall teach thee
public instruction should be the first object of government
everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching
tears are summer showers to the soul
for beautys tears are lovelier than her smile
words that weep and tears that speak
never a tear bedims the eye that time and patience will not dry
oh
would i were dead now or up in my bed now to cover my head now and have a good cry
if the man who turnips cries cry not when his father dies tis proof that he had rather have a turnip than his father
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
it is some relief to weep grief is satisfied and carried off by tears
if you have tears prepare to shed them now
tears are the silent language of grief
all television is educational television
the question is what is it teaching
he who prides himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy
of all the dramatic media radio is the most visual
television
the word is half latin and half greek
no good can come of it
televisions compelling power is its immediacy
this immediacy feeds the politics of emotions gut reactions and impressions rather than the politics of logic facts and reason it emphasizes personality rather than issues
television is the literature of the illiterate the culture of the lowbrow the wealth of the poor the privilege of the underprivileged the exclusive club of the excluded masses
i can get a better grasp of what is going on in the world from one good washington dinner party than from all the background information nbc piles on my desk
when television is good nothing is better
but when television is bad nothing is worse
i invite you to sit down in front of your tv set and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off
i can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland
television has proved that people will look at anything rather than each other
television is a gold goose that lays scrambled eggs and it is futile and probably fatal to beat it for not laying caviar
television is chewing gum for the eyes
in the age of television image becomes more important than substance
television is the first truly democratic culture  the first culture available to everybody and entirely governed by what the people want
the most terrifying thing is what people do want
television has a real problem
they have no page two
good heavens television is something you appear on you dont watch
television is an invention that permits you to be entertained in your living room by people you wouldnt have in your home
why should people pay good money to go out and see bad films when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing
the television commercial is the most efficient powerpacked capsule of education that appears anywhere on tv
television is not the truth
television is a goddamned amusement park
television is a circus a carnival a travelling troupe of acrobats storytellers dancers singers jugglers sideshow freaks lion tamers and football players
were in the boredomkilling business
dictum on television scripts we dont want it good  we want it tuesday
ive had several years in hollywood and i still think the movie heroes are in the audience
the first draught serveth for health the second for pleasure the third for shame and the fourth for madness
every moderate drinker could abandon the intoxicating cup if he would every inebriate would if he could
drinking water neither makes a man sick nor in debt nor his wife a widow
the smaller the drink the clearer the head and the cooler the blood
all men are tempted
there is no man that lives that cant be broken down provided it is the right temptation put in the right spot
there are several good protections against temptation but the surest is cowardice
temptation rarely comes in working hours
it is in their leisure time that men are made or marred
things forbidden have a secret charm
after listening to thousands of pleas for pardon to offenders i can hardly recall a case where i did not feel that i might have fallen as my fellow man had done if i had been subjected to the same demoralizing influences and pressed by the same temptations
i have a simple principle for the conduct of life  never to resist an adequate temptation
if the world were merely seductive that would be easy
if it were merely challenging that would be no problem
but i rise in the morning torn between a desire to improve or save the world and a desire to enjoy or savour the world
this makes it hard to plan the day
the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it
resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself
never give in never give in never never never never  in nothing great or small large or petty  never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense
i generally avoid temptation unless i cant resist it
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life
honest bread is very well  its the butter that makes the temptation
get thee behind me satan
never resist temptation prove all things hold fast that which is good
i can resist everything except temptation
one thing i can guarantee you
you may not be a great deal wiser from my talk today but you will be a great deal older
i want to thank everybody who made this day necessary
i really dont deserve this but i have arthritis and i dont deserve that either
i explained to him i had simple tastes and didnt want anything ostentatious no matter what it costs
i feel a very unusual sensation  if it is not indigestion i think it must be gratitude
i forgot they were talking about me
they sound so wonderfully convincing
ive always been well liked
i was so popular in school everybody hated me
the audience was swell
they were so polite they covered their mouths when they yawned
ive been here so long


when i got here the dead sea wasnt even sick yet
a closed mouth gathers no foot
some people speak from experience while others from experience dont speak
the best way to save face is keep the bottom half shut
it is almost impossible to find those who admire us entirely lacking in taste
admiration our polite recognition of another mans resemblance to ourselves
a good storyteller is a person who has a good memory and hopes other people havent
adam was the only man who when he said a good thing knew that nobody had said it before him
the trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism
dont worry if your you is small and your rewards are few remember that the mighty oak was once a nut like you
a sense of humor is what makes you laugh at something that would make you mad if it happened to you
if noah found himself back on earth you can bet all he would recognize would be the jokes
a sense of humor is the ability to laugh at your own jokes when your friends tell them
the trouble with eating italian food is that five or six days later youre hungry again
nouvelle cuisine roughly translated means i cant believe i spent ninetysix dollars and im still hungry
ive had a wonderful evening


but this wasnt it
a conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking
there are no perfect people  except of course my wifes first husband
ladies and gentlemen you cant please everyone
take my girlfriend  i think shes the most remarkable woman in the world



thats me


but to my wife


i love a finished speaker i really truly do
i dont mean one whos polished i just mean one whos through
remember if god had wanted this to be perfect he never would have had me up here
it is always dullest before the yawn
i noticed you werent checking your watches   youve been shaking them
id like to thank the committee that brought this event about
it was an equal endeavor
they did the food decorations and reservations and i did the traffic flow
better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime
heres to one of the most beautiful kind thoughtful people i have ever known


you are getting more like me every day
another fine mess youve got us in stanley
he who laughs last thinks slowest
lets face it some days youre the pigeon and some days youre the statue
if there is anyone here whom i have not insulted i beg his pardon
dont move
i want to forget you just the way you are
i thank you for not snoring
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever
beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks
how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child
heap high the board with plenteous cheer and gather to the feast and toast the sturdy pilgrim band whose courage never ceased
give praise to that allgracious one by whom their steps were led and thanks unto the harvests lord who sends our daily bread
brotherton so once in every year we throng upon a day apart to praise the lord with feast and song in thankfulness of heart
fear is the denomination of the old testament belief is the denomination of the new
the english of the bible has a pithiness and raciness a homely tang a terse sententiousness an idiomatic flavour which comes home to mens business and bosoms  a nobility of diction and  a rhythmic quality


unrivaled in its beauty
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith
behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world
that kind of socalled housekeeping where they have six bibles and no corkscrew
the total absence of humour in the bible is one of the most singular things in all literature
the old and new testaments are the great code of art
the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge
i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith
i am fearfully and wonderfully made
the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house
oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt
a prophet is not without honour save in his own country
be not curious in unnecessary matters for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand
seek not out the things that are too hard for thee neither search the things that are above thy strength
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace
his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow
ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you
be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
watchman what of the night
man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets
the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle
borne the burden and heat of the day
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose
entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me
we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept
i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot
they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman
when caught reading the bible wc fields said tm looking for loopholes
the bible is nothing but a succession of civil rights struggles by the jewish people against their oppressors
out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
unto everyone that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
he that is not with me is against me
man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
for what is your life
it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away
my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle
i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart
the bible should be taught so early and so thoroughly that it sinks straight to the bottom of the mind where everything that comes along can settle on it
a great city is not to be confounded with a populous one
a hick town is one in which there is no place to go where you shouldnt be
city life  millions of people being lonesome together
we might define an eccentric as a man who is law unto himself and a crank as one who having determined what the law is insists on laying it down to others
the country has charms only for those not obliged to stay there
a great city a great solitude
in small settlements everyone knows your affairs
in the big city everyone does not  only those you choose to tell will know about you
this is one of the attributes of cities that is precious to most city people
if you would be known and not know vegetate in a village if you would know and not be known live in a city
farmers worry only during the growing season but town people worry all the time
what is the city but the people
as a remedy to life in society i would suggest the big city
nowadays it is the only desert within our reach
all cities are mad but the madness is gallant
all cities are beautiful but the beauty is grim
the chicken is the countrys but the city eats it
cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining but they make them artificial
the city is a cultural invention enforcing on the citizen knowledge of his own nature
and this we do not like
that we are aggressive beings easily given to violence that we get along together because we must more than because we want to and that the brotherhood of man is about as far from reality today as it was two thousand years ago that reasons realm is small that we never have been and never shall be created equal that if the human being is perfectible he has so far exhibited few symptoms  all are considerations of man from which space tends to protect us
there is nothing good to be had in the country or if there be they will not let you have it
anybody can be good in the country
there are no temptations there
the axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of each and every town or city
to say the least a town life makes one more tolerant and liberal in ones judgement of others
commuters give the city its tidal restlessness natives give it solidity and continuity but the settlers give it passion
summertime oh summertime pattern of life indelible the fadeproof lake the woods unshatterable the pasture with the sweetfern and the juniper forever and ever


the cottages with their innocent and tranquil design their tiny docks with the flagpole and the american flag floating against the white clouds in the blue sky the little paths over the roots of the trees leading from camp to camp
this was the american family at play escaping the city heat
there is no solitude in the world like that of the big city
upper classes are a nations past the middleclass is its future
people are afraid of the future of the unknown
if a man faces up to it and takes the dare of the future he can have some control over his destiny
thats an exciting idea to me better than waiting with everybody else to see whats going to happen
tomorrow is the most important thing in life
comes in to us at midnight very clean
its perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands and hopes weve learnt something from yesterday
nothing in the world can one imagine beforehand not the least thing
everything is made up of so many unique particulars that cannot be foreseen
you can never plan the future by the past
one must care about a world one will not see
if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me
the future is something which every one reaches at the rate of sixty miles an hour whatever he does whoever he is
my interest is in the future because i am going to spend the rest of my life there
tomorrow is a satire on today and shows its weakness
the future comes one day at a time
never let the future disturb you
you will meet it if you have to with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present
what we look for does not come to pass
god finds a way for what none foresaw
with high hope for the future no prediction is ventured
we can pay our debt to the past by putting the future in debt to ourselves
the future is not a gift  it is an achievement
the world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is in fact a return to the idealized past
that which is escaped now is pain to come
light tomorrow with today
if tomorrow were never to come it would not be worth living today
the afternoon knows what the morning never suspected
the future is purchased by the present
life is an irreversible process and for that reason its future can never be a repetition of the past
i believe the future is only the past again entered through another gate
the world will be saved by one or two people
it is a mistake to look too far ahead
only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time
it is seldom in life that one knows that a coming event is to be of crucial importance
neither in the life of the individual nor in that of mankind is it desirable to know the future
there is only one large circle that we march in around and around each of us with our own little picturein front of usour own little mirage that we think is the future
god made the world round so we would never be able to see too far down the road
the future comes one day at a time
there is a case and a strong case for that particular form of indolence that allows us to move through life knowing only what immediately concerns us
cease to inquire what the future has in store and take as a gift whatever the day brings forth
there is no data on the future
the best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time
hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future
the future is hidden even from those who make it
they who lose today may win tomorrow
be of good cheer
do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow
you have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles
remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost
when all else is lost the future still remains
there is hope for all of us
well anyway if you dont die you live through it day in day out
our faith in the present dies out long before our faith in the future
i have been nothing  but there is tomorrow
after all tomorrow is another day
everyone has it within his power to say this i am today that i shall be tomorrow
he who foresees calamities suffers them twice over
only man clogs his happiness with care destroying what is with thoughts of what may be
it is never safe to look into the future with eyes of fear
if you are afraid for your future you dont have a present
he that fears not the future may enjoy the present
cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once
the future is called perhaps which is the only possible thing to call the future
and the important thing is not to allow that to scare you
to relinquish a present good through apprehension of a future evil is in most instances unwise  from a fear which may afterwards turn out groundless you lost the good that lay within your grasp
nothing in life is more remarkable than the unnecessary anxiety which we endure and generally create ourselves
every man through fear mugs his aspirations a dozen times a day
the mere apprehension of a coming evil has put many into a situation of the utmost danger
we need not be afraid of the future for the future will be in our own hands
i am not afraid of tomorrow for i have seen yesterday and i love today
go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart
we grow in time to trust the future for our answers
every tomorrow has two handles
we can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith
put aside the need to know some future design and simply leave your life open to what is needed of it by the divine forces
see how time makes all grief decay
the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
let us move forward with strong and active faith
it is not the cares of today but the cares of tomorrow that weigh a man down
for the needs of today we have corresponding strength given
for the morrow we are told to trust
it is not ours yet
take therefore no thought of the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself
tomorrow is the day when idlers work and fools reform and mortal men lay hold on heaven
tomorrow is the mysterious unknown guest
tomorrow is the only day in the year that appeals to a lazy man
the future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is
the future is a world limited by ourselvesin it we discover only what concerns us
the future is only the past again entered through another gate
the future is the most expensive luxury in the world
the future is the shape of things to come
the future is the past in preparation
to the being of fully alive the future is not ominous but a promise it surrounds the present like a halo
the future is hope
the future is a great land
the future is wider than vision and has no end
losing the future is the best thing that ever happened to me
grow old along with me
the best is yet to be
i have always been driven by some distant musica battle hymn no doubtfor i have been at war from the beginning
ive never looked back before
ive never had the time and it has always seemed so dangerous
he who lives in the future lives in a featureless blank he lives in impersonality he lives in nirvana
the past is democratic because it is a people
the future is despotic because it is a caprice
every man is alone in his prediction just as each man is alone in a dream
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
when i look to the future its so bright it burns my eyes
i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
i never think of the future
it comes soon enough
you cannot plan the future by the past
it is when tomorrows burden is added to the burden of today that the weight is more than a man can bear
my interest is in the future because i am going to spend the rest of my life there
yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose
the possibilities for tomorrow are usually beyond our expectations
where will i be five years from now
i delight in not knowing
thats one of the greatest things about lifeits wonderful surprises
when i look at the future its so bright it burns my eyes
everyones future is in reality uncertain and full of unknown treasures from which all may draw unguessed prizes
the future is made of the same stuff as the present
the future is much like the present only longer
byandby never comes
the bridges you cross before you come to them are over rivers that arent there
strike when thou wilt the hour of rest but let my last days be my best
for you and me today is all we have tomorrow is a mirage that may never become reality
i fear there will be no future for those who do not change
if a man carefully examines his thoughts he will be surprised to find how much he lives in the future
his wellbeing is always ahead
i got the blues thinking of the future so i left off and made some marmalade
its amazing how it cheers one up to shred oranges and scrub the floor
you learn to build your roads on today because tomorrows ground is too uncertain for plans and futures have a way of falling down in midflight
fortunately for children the uncertainties of the present always give way to the enchanted possibilities of the future
a house may draw visitors but it is the possessor alone that can detain them
a mans home is his wifes castle
i want a house that has got over all its troubles i dont want to spend the rest of my life bringing up a young and inexperienced house
the great advantage of a hotel is that its a refuge from home life
the surroundings householders crave are glorified autobiographies
home is not where you live but where they understand you
where thou art that is home
home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in
a man builds a fine house and now he has a master and a task for life is to furnish watch show it and keep it in repair the rest of his life
the strength of a nation especially of a republican nation is in the intelligent and wellordered homes of the people
justice was born outside the home and a long way from it and it has never been adopted there
the home of everyone is to him his castle and fortress as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose
pride avarice and envy are in every home
of all modern notions the worst is this that domesticity is dull
inside the home they say is dead decorum and routine outside is adventure and variety
but the truth is that the home is the only place of liberty the only spot on earth where a man can alter arrangements suddenly make an experiment or indulge in a whim
the home is not the one tame place in a world of adventure it is the one wild place in a world of rules and set tasks
i have come back again to where i belong not an enchanted place but the walls are strong
to mankind in general macbeth and lady macbeth stand out as the supreme type of all that a host and hostess should not be
the fellow that owns his own home is always just coming out of a hardware store
common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18
curiosity is a lust of the mind
gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us
the heart of a statesman should be in his head
minds like bodies will often fall into a pimpled illconditioned state from mere excess of comfort
of course he seems to have quite a mind of his own and that is probably where he is weakest
that is the consolation of a little mind you have the fun of changing it without impeding the progress of mankind
the flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind those of the past and future as well as the present
the mind of man is capable of anything  because everything is in it all the past as well as all the future
then comes winston with his hundred horsepower mind and what can i do
we know the human brain is a device to keep the ears from grating on one another
one man who has a mind and knows it can always beat ten men who havent and dont
when the mind is thinking it is talking to itself
i am not absentminded
it is the presence of mind that makes me unaware of everything else
our unconsciousness is like a vast subterranean factory with intricate machinery that is never idle where work goes on day and night from the time we are born until the moment of our death
only an incompetent mind is content to express itself incompetently
a great many open minds should be closed for repairs
if you keep your mind sufficiently open people will throw a lot of rubbish into it
merely having an open mind is nothing
the object of opening the mind as of opening the mouth is to shut it again on something solid
the perversion of the mind is only possible when those who should be heard in its defence are silent
our minds are lazier than our bodies
strength is a matter of the madeup mind
what we think and feel and are is to a great extent determined by the state of our ductless glands and our viscera
the feeling of inferiority rules the mental life and can be clearly recognized as the sense of incompleteness and unfulfillment and in the uninterrupted struggle both of individuals and of humanity
discipline does not mean suppression and control nor is it adjustment to a pattern or ideology
it means a mind that sees what is and learns from what was
that which enters the mind through reason can be corrected
that which is admitted through faith hardly ever
vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory
nostalgia is a seductive liar
was it always my nature to take a bad time and block out the good times until any success became an accident and failure seemed the only truth
nostalgia a device that removes the ruts and potholes from memory lane
what was hard to bear is sweet to remember
the hearts memory eliminates the bad and magnifies the good and thanks to this artifice we manage to endure the burdens of the past
some folks never exaggeratethey just remember big
a mans memory may almost become the art of continually varying and misrepresenting his past according to his interest in the present
praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear
god gave us memory that we might have roses in december
there has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present
only sick music makes money today
children today are tyrants
they contradict their parents gobble their food and tyrannize their teachers
posterity will say as usual in the past things were better the present is worse than the past
our ignorance of history makes us libel to our own times
people have always been like this
oh this age
how tasteless and illbred it is
this strange disease of modern life with its sick hurry its divided aims
the illusion that times that were are better than those that are has probably pervaded all ages
oh what times
oh what standards
probably no one alive hasnt at one time or another brooded over the possibility of going back to an earlier ideal age in his existence and living a different kind of life
the golden age was never the present age
the worst time is always the present
the good old timesall times when old are good
the good old days
the only good days are ahead
there are two kinds of stones as everyone knows one which rolls
recognizing what we have done in the past is a recognition of ourselves
by conducting a dialogue with our past we are searching how to go forward
i know of no way of judging the future but by the past
those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
to look backward for a while is to refresh the eye to restore it and to render it more fit for its prime function of looking forward
the past is never deadit is not even past
the past is the best way to suppose what may come
we can never go back again that much is certain
the past is still too close to us
the things we have tried to forget and put behind us would stir again and that sense of fear of furtive unrest might in some manner unforeseen become a living companion as it had before
past our cradle not our prison and there is danger as well as appeal in its glamour
the past is for inspiration not imitation for continuation not repetition
life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward
when i want to understand what is happening today or try to decide what will happen tomorrow i look back
we live in the present we dream of the future but we learn eternal truths from the past
the past is the best prophet of the future
truth however bitter can be accepted and woven into a design for living
the past will not tell us what we ought to do but what we ought to avoid
tomorrow hopes we have learned something from yesterday
judgement comes from experience and great judgement comes from bad experience
the only use of a knowledge of the past is to equip us for the present
when the past has taught us that we have more within us than we have ever used our prayer is a cry to the divine to come to us and fill us with its power
dont ruin the present with the ruined past
ah tell me not that memory sheds gladness oer the past what is recalled by faded flowers save that they did not last
here lies my past goodbye i have kissed it thank you kids i wouldnt have missed it
forget the past and live the present hour
living in the past is a dull and lonely business looking back strains the neck muscles causes you to bump into people not going your way
i demolish my bridges behind me  then there is no choice but forward
looking repeatedly into the past you do not necessarily become fascinated with your own life but rather with the phenomenon of memory
let the past drift away with the water
the past cannot be changed
the future is yet in your power
i have very strong feelings about how you lead your life
you always look ahead you never look back
not the power to remember but its very opposite the power to forget is a necessary condition for our existence
you cannot step twice into the same river for other waters are continually flowing on
better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad
the past should be culled like a box of fresh strawberries rinsed of debris sweetened judiciously and served in small portions not very often
may i forget what ought to be forgotten and recall unfailing all that ought to be recalled each kindly thing forgetting what might sting
heres to the past
thank god its past
one must be thrust out of a finished cycle in life and that leap is the most difficult to maketo part with ones faith ones love when one would prefer to renew the faith and recreate the passion
the biggest thing in todays sorrow is the memory of yesterdays joy
its but little good youll go awatering the last years crop
the worst thing you can do is to try to cling to something thats gone or to recreate it
neer look for the birds of this year in the nests of the last
dont look back
something may be gaining on you
anyone who limits her vision to memories of yesterday is already dead
i like the dreams for the future better than the history of the past
the first recipe for happiness is avoid too lengthy meditations on the past
the past is a funeral gone by
never let yesterday use up today
how the past perishes is how the future becomes
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
in the life of the spirit there is no ending that is not a beginning
the past is but the beginning of a beginning and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn
anyone who limits her vision to memories of yesterday is already dead
nor deem the irrevocable past as wholly wasted wholly vain if rising on its wrecks at last to something nobler we attain
youth is after all just a moment but it is the moment the spark that you always carry in your heart
nothing is predestined the obstacles of your past can become the gateways that lead to new beginnings
no star is ever lost we once have seen we always may be what we might have been
whats past is prologue
in my end is my beginning
the good old days were never that good believe me
the good new days are today and better days are coming tomorrow
our greatest songs are still unsung
the past is never completely lost khowever extensive the devastation
your sorrows are the bricks and mortar of a magnificent temple
what you are today and what you will be tomorrow are because of what you have been
fear not for the future weep not for the past
there are two days about which nobody should ever worry and these are yesterday and tomorrow
we crucify ourselves between two thieves regret for yesterday and fear of tomorrow
every saint has a past and every sinner has a future
when i am anxious it is because i am living in the future
when i am depressed it is because i am living in the past
im not convinced that the world is in any worse shape than it ever was
its just that in this age of almost instantaneous communication we bear the weight of problems our forefathers only read about after they were solved
truth has no beginning
the worlds history is constant like the laws of nature and simple like the souls of men
these are the stories that never never die that are carried like seed into a new country are told to you and me and make in us new and lasting strengths
what one loves in childhood stays in the heart forever
this time like all times is a very good one if we but know what to do with it
in times like these it helps to recall that there have always been times like these
our ignorance of history makes us libel our own times
people have always been like this
the good old days are neither better nor worse than the ones were living through right now
where i was born and where and how i have lived is unimportant
it is what i have done with where i have been that should be of interest
respect the past in the full measure of its deserts but do not make the mistake of confusing it with the present nor seek in it the ideals of the future
its a pleasure to share ones memories
everything remembered is dear endearing touching precious
at least the past is safethough we didnt know it at the time
we know it now
because its in the past because we have survived
the events in our lives happen in a sequence in time but in their significance to ourselves they find their own order  the continuous thread of revelation
the best compliment we can pay our past is to prophetically and bravely face today and tomorrow
some memories are realities and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again
fortunate are the people whose roots are deep
as the dew to the blossom the bud to the bee as the scent to the rose are those memories to me
heirlooms we dont have in our family
but stories weve got
we have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future
the past is a guidepost not a hitching post
the past in retrospect holds manifold disenchantments failures and even tragedies and yet the worse may be forgotten and the best held fast
the road was new to me as roads always are going back
no yesterdays are ever wasted for those who give themselves to today
yesterday i lived today i suffer tomorrow i die but i still think fondly today and tomorrow of yesterday
each has his past shut in him like the leaves of a book shown to him by heart and his friends can only read the title
we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not we forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget
the past is a work of art free of irrelevancies and loose ends
the past is a foreign country they do things differently there
the past with its pleasures its rewards its foolishness its punishments is there for each of us forever and it should be
the past is that which we possess fully and in whole
our deeds still travel with us from afar and what we have been makes us what we are
the past is the tomorrow that got away
our life is like some vast lake that is slowly filling with the stream of our years
as the waters creep surely upward the landmarks of the past are one by one submerged
but there shall always be memory to lift its head above the tide until the lake is overflowing
why should we grope among the dry bones of the past or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe
no past is dead for us but only sleeping love
i look back on my life like a good days work it is done and i am satisfied with it
of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been
that sign of old age extolling the past at the expense of the present
the past is one evil less and one memory more
then is then
now is now
we must grow to learn the difference
the past not merely is not fugitive it remains present
the past which is so presumptuously brought forward as a precedent for the present was itself founded on some past that went before it
old times never come back and i suppose its just as well
what comes back is a new morning every day in the year and thats better
we have inherited new difficulties because we have inherited more privileges
people are always asking about the good old days
i say why dont you say the good now days
isnt now the only time youre living
life in the twentieth century undeniably has  such richness joy and adventure as were unknown to our ancestors except in their dreams
enjoy yourself
these are the good old days youre going to miss in the years ahead
the past is our very being
to disdain today is to prove that yesterday has been misunderstood
the universe is made of stories not of atoms
this is not a dress rehearsal
this is it
only when your consciousness is totally focused on the moment you are in can you receive whatever gift esson or delight that moment has to
seize the day and put the least possible trust in tomorrow
tomorrows life is too late
live today
one today is worth two tomorrows
half of today is better than all of tomorrow
never put off until tomorrow what you can do today because if you enjoy it today you can do it again tomorrow
today is the first day of the rest of your life
the present moment is significant not as the bridge between past and future but by reason of its contents which can fill our emptiness and become ours if we are capable of receiving them
all of us tend to put off living
we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today
its not that today is the first day of the rest of my life but that now is all there is of my life
we want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers damn is the history we make today
now is the only time we own give love toil with a will
and place no faith in tomorrow for the clock may then be still
enjoy yourself drink call the life you live today your ownbut only that the rest belongs to chance
you are younger today than you ever will be again
make use of it for the sake of tomorrow
if we are ever to enjoy life now is the time not tomorrow or next year
today should always be our most wonderful day
live now believe me wait not till tomorrow gather the roses of life today
so often we rob tomorrows memories by todays economies
you had better live your best and act your best and think your best today for today is the sure preparation for tomorrow and all the other tomorrows that follow
happy the man and happy he alone he can call today his own
he who secure within can say tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today
forget mistakes
forget failures
forget everything except what youre going to do now and do it
today is your lucky day
yesterday is ashes tomorrow wood
only today does the fire burn brightly
one of these days is none of these days
this is the day which the lord has made
let us rejoice and be glad in it
he growled at morning noon and night and trouble sought to borrow although today the sky was bright he knew twould storm tomorrow a thought of joy he could not stand and struggled to resist it though sunshine dappled all the land this sorry pessimist it
to those leaning on the sustaining infinite today is big with blessings
the hereandnow is no mere filling of time but a filling of time with god
in the present every day is a miracle
life is only this place this time and these people right here and now
i believe that only one person in a thousand knows the trick of really living in the present
there is one thing we can do and the happiest people are those who do it to the limit of their ability
we can be completely present
we can be all here
we can  give all our attention to the opportunity before us
the more i give myself permission to live in the moment and enjoy it without feeling guilty or judgmental about any other time the better i feel about the quality of my work
actact in the living present
are not my days few
cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little before i go to the place from which i shall not return
now or never was the time
and now lord what wait i for
the future belongs to those who live intensely in the present
the present is elastic to embrace infinity
the present is the living sumtotal of the whole past
the present is an eternal now
the present is all the ready money fate can give
the present is an edifice which god cannot rebuild
the present is the blocks with which we build
the present is the symbol and vehicle of the future
the present is all you have for your certain possession
we are here and it is now
further than that all knowledge is moonshine
having spent the better part of my life trying either to relive the past or experience the future before it arrives i have come to believe that in between these two extremes is peace
this time like all times is a very good one if we but know what to do with it
the time is always right to do what is right
one realm we have never conquered the pure present
he who lives in the present lives in eternity
i am in the present
i cannot know what tomorrow will bring forth
i can know only what the truth is for me today
that is what i am called upon to serve
the present offers itself to our touch for only an instant of time and then eludes the senses
a life uncommanded now is uncommanded a life unenjoyed now is unenjoyed a life not lived wisely now is not lived wisely
the word now is like a bomb thrown through the window and it ticks
whether its the best of times or the worst of times its the only time weve got
it is now and in this world that we must live
who cares about great marks left behind
we have one life just one
our life
we have nothing else
thisthe immediate everyday and present experienceis it the entire and ultimate point for the existence of a universe
let us live today
work accomplished means little
it is in the past
what we all want is the glorious and living present
yesterday is a cancelled check
tomorrow is a promissory note
today is cash in hand
spend it
today relative to yesterday or tomorrow the future is made of the same stuff as the present
yesterday is but a dream tomorrow is only a vision
but today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope
look well therefore to this day for it is life the very life of life
be glad today
tomorrow may bring tears
be brave today
the darkest night will pass
and golden rays will usher in the dawn
do not look back on happiness or dream of it in the future
you are only sure of today do not let yourself be cheated out of it
existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past present and future
i am not afraid of tomorrow for i have seen yesterday and i love today
the past the present and the future are really one they are today
the present contains all that there is
it is holy ground for it is the past and it is the future
there is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future
with the past i have nothing to do nor with the future
i live now
children have neither a past nor a future
thus they enjoy the present which seldom happens to us
the past is a bucket of ashes so live not in your yesterdays nor just for tomorrow but in the here and now
youth is the time of getting middle age of improving and old age of spending
it is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you but ever that of the present alone
even this burden too can be lessened if you confine it strictly to its own limits
reappraise the past reevaluate where weve been clarify where we are and predict or anticipate where we are headed
we can easily manage if we will only take each day the burden appointed to it
but the load will be too heavy for us if we carry yesterdays burden over again today and then add the burden of the morrow before we are required to bear it
take in the ideas of the day drain off those of yesterday
as to the morrow time enough to consider it when it becomes today
tomorrow i will live the fool does say today itselfs too late the wise lived yesterday
the cares of today are seldom those of tomorrow
yesterday is a cancelled check tomorrow is a promissory note today is the only cash you haveso spend it wisely
everymans life lies within the present for the past is spent and done with and the future is uncertain
the flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind those of the past and future as well
i try to learn from the past but i plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present
thats where the fun is
no mind is much employed upon the present recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our moments
the only living life is in the past and futurethe present is an interlude strange interlude in which we call on past and future to bear witness that we are living
past and to come seems best things present worst
the past cannot be regained although we can learn from it the future is not yet ours even though we must plan for it
time is now
we have only today
look not mournfully into the past it comes not back again
wisely improve the present it is thine
go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart
no longer forward nor behind i look in hope or fear but grateful take the good i find the best of now and here
the present like a note in music is nothing but as it appertains to what is past and what is to come
we can see well into the past we can guess shrewdly in to the future but that which is rolled up and muffled in impenetrable folds is today
the present time is seldom able to fill desire or imagination with immediate enjoyment and we are forced to supply its deficiencies by recollection or anticipation
be satisfied and pleased with what thou art act cheerfully and well thy allotted part enjoy the present hour be thankful for the past and neither fear nor wish the approaches of the last
it is difficult to live in the present ridiculous to live in the future and impossible to live in the past
if you have one eye on yesterday and one eye on tomorrow youre going to be cockeyed today
yesterday has gone
tomorrow may never come
there is only the miracle of this moment
savor it
it is a gift
dont waste today regretting yesterday instead of making a memory for tomorrow
light tomorrow with today
i just take one day
yesterday is gone
tomorrow has not come
we have only today to love jesus
patterns of the past echo in the present and resound through the future
who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past
if we spend our time with regrets over yesterday and worries over what might happen tomorrow we have no today in which to live
now is all we have
everything that has ever happened to you and anything that is ever going to happen to you is just a thought
the present is the necessary product of all the past the necessary cause of all the future
if we open a quarrel between the past and the present we shall find we have lost the future
few of us ever live in the present we are forever anticipating what is to come or remembering what has gone
the secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past not to worry about the future nor to anticipate troubles but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly
when we have a world of only now with no shadows of yesterdays or clouds of tomorrow then saying what we can do will work
i can feel guilty about the past apprehensive about the future but only in the present can i act
the ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness
i have realized that the past and the future are real illusions that they exist only in the present which is what there is and all that there is
there is no present or future only the past happening over and over again now
today was once the future from which you expected so much in the past
today is yesterdays pupil
today is yesterdays effect and tomorrows cause
through loyalty to the past our mind refuses to realize that tomorrows joy is possible only if todays makes way for it that each wave owes the beauty of its line only to the withdrawal of the preceding one
the present is the now the here through which all future plunges to the past
i have everything i need to enjoy my here and nowunless i am letting my consciousness be dominated by demands and expectations based on the dead past or the imagined future
today is the blocks with which we build
in order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past which i often did not fully enjoy because i was comparing them with other moments of the future
seize from every moment its unique novelty and do not prepare your joys
you dont need endless time and perfect conditions
do it now
do it today
do it for twenty minutes and watch your heart start beating
do not manage as if you had ten thousand years before you
look you death stands at your elbow make the most of your minute and be good for something while it is in your power
and if not now when
as we are always preparing to be happy it is inevitable that we should never be so
why not seize the pleasure at once
how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation
when shall we live if not now
we cannot put off living until we are ready
the most salient characteristic of life is its coerciveness it is always urgent here and now without any possible postponement
life is fired at us pointblank
very few men properly speaking live at present but are providing to live another time
real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present
freedom from worries and surcease from strain are illusions that always inhabit the distance
study as if you were to live forever
live as if you were to die tomorrow
the best preparation for a better life next year is a full complete harmonious joyous life this year
if you spend your whole life waiting for the storm youll never enjoy the sunshine
some people are making such thorough preparation for rainy days that they arent enjoying todays sunshine
the greater part of our lives is spent in dreaming over the morrow and when it comes it too is consumed in the anticipation of a brighter morrow and so the cheat is prolonged even to the grave
it is cheap generosity which promises the future in compensation for the present
who knows if the gods above will add tomorrows span to this days sum
defer not till tomorrow to be wise tomorrows sun to thee may never rise
my head is buried in the sands of tomorrow while my tail feathers are singed by the hot sun of today
today well lived will prepare me for both the pleasure and the pain of tomorrow
the future belongs to those who live intensely in the present
every moment that i am centered in the future i suffer a temporary loss of this life
we know nothing of tomorrow our business is to be good and happy today
we are always beginning to live but are never living
live wastes itself while we are preparing to live
i have always been waiting for something bettersometimes to see the best i had snatched from me
men spend their lives in anticipation in determining to be vastly happy at some period when they have time
but the present time has one advantage over every otherit is our own we may lay in a stock of pleasures as we would lay in a stock of wine but if we defer the tasting of them too long we shall find that both are soured by age
you do well to have visions of a better life than of every day but it is the life of every day from which the elements of a better life must come
the most effective way to ensure the value of the future is to confront the present courageously and constructively
the habit of looking into the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one
there can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts
you dont save a pitcher for tomorrow
tomorrow it may rain
very strange is this quality of our human nature which decrees that unless we feel a future before us we do not live completely in the present
just do your best today and tomorrow will come  tomorrows going to be a busy day a happy day
do todays duty fight todays temptation do not weaken and distract yourself by looking forward to things you cannot see and could not understand if you saw them
the best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today
live for today
multitudes of people have failed to live for today
what they have had within their grasp today they have missed entirely because only the future has intrigued them
present opportunities are neglected and attainable good is slighted by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages
light tomorrow with today
a preoccupation with the future not only prevents us from seeing the present as it is but often prompts us to rearrange the past
the man least dependent upon the morrow goes to meet the morrow most cheerfully
todays egg is better than tomorrows hen
twere too absurd to slight for the hereafter the days delight
the best part of our lives we pass in counting on what is to come
it seems to be the fate of man to seek all his consolations in futurity
the prospect of being pleased tomorrow will never console me for the boredom of today
to live only for some future goal is shallow
its the sides of the mountain that sustain life not the top
we steal if we touch tomorrow
it is gods
the past and present are only our means the future is always our end
thus we never really live but only hope to live
the president is the representative of the whole nation and hes the only lobbyist that all the one hundred and sixty million people in this country have
trying to make the presidency work these days is like trying to sew buttons on a custard pie
th prisidincy is th highest office in th gift iv th people
th viceprisidincy is th next highest an the lowest
it isnt a crime exactly
ye cant be sint to jail f r it but its a kind iv a disgrace
seriously i do not think i am fit for the presidency
an eminent american is reported to have said to friends who wished to put him forward gentlemen let there be no mistake
i should make a good president but a very bad candidate
well i wouldnt say that i was in the great class but i had a great time while i was trying to be great
the presidency does not yield to definition
like the glory of a morning sunrise it can be experienced  it can not be told
when the president does it that means it is not illegal
a presidents hardest task is not to do whats right but to know whats right
had i been chosen president again i am certain i could not have lived another year
the four most miserable years of my life


if you are as happy my dear sir on entering this house as i am in leaving it and returning home you are the happiest man in the country
i feel like the man who was tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail
to the man who asked how he liked it he said if it wasnt for the honour of the thing id rather walk
the office of president requires the constitution of an athlete the patience of a mother the endurance of an early christian
within the first few months i discovered that being a president is like riding a tiger
a man has to keep riding or be swallowed
harricum
harricum
give em hell harricum
in america any boy may become president and i suppose its just one of the risks he takes
i have no expectation of making a hit every time i come to bat
i think the american public wants a solemn ass as a president and i think ill go along with them
i desire to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end
i have lost every friend on earth i shall have one friend left and that friend shall be down inside me
the final greatness of the presidency lies in the truth that it is not just an office of incredible power but a breeding ground of indestructible myth
i beg leave to assure the congress that no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness
i do not wish to make any profit from it
nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result
dont let it be forgot that once there was a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as camelot
the buck stops here
the ocean and i have many pebbles to find and wash off and roll into shape
the sea possesses a power over ones moods that has the effect of a will
the sea can hypnotize
nature in general can do so
roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean  roll
ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain man marks the earth with ruin  his control stops with the shore
the sea  the truth must be confessed  has no generosity
no display of manly qualities  courage hardihood endurance faithfulness  has ever been known to touch its irresponsible consciousness of power
being in a ship is being in a jail with the chance of being drowned
the sea hath no king but god alone
love the sea
i dote upon it  from the beach
i liked to sail alone
the sea was the same as a girl to me  i did not want anyone else along
i do not love the sea
the look of it is disquieting
there is something in the very sound of it that stirs the premonition felt while we listen to noble music we become inexplicably troubled
the only cure for seasickness is to sit on the shady side of an old church in the country
i have observed on board a steamer how men and women easily give way to their instinct for flirtation because water has the power of washing away our sense of responsibility and those who on land resemble the oak in their firmness behave like floating seaweed when on the sea
a poor woman from manchester on being taken to the seaside is said to have expressed her delight on seeing for the first time something of which there was enough for everybody
theres never an end for the sea
april is the cruellest month breeding lilacs out of the dead land mixing memory and desire stirring dull roots with spring rain
autumn wins you best by this its mute appeal to sympathy for its decay
honest winter snowclad and with the frosted beard i can welcome not uncordially but that long deferment of the calendars promise that weeping gloom of march and april that bitter blast outraging the honour of may how often has it robbed me of heart and hope
no one thinks of winter when the grass is green
no winter lasts forever no spring skips its turn
april is a promise that may is bound to keep and we know it
the nicest thing about the promise of spring is that sooner or later shell have to keep it
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york
every april god rewrites the book of genesis
the changing years progressive plan proclaims mortality to man
summer is the mother of the poor
take a winter as you find him and he turns out to be a thoroughly honest fellow with no nonsense in him and tolerating none in you which is a great comfort in the long run
summer ends and autumn comes and he who would have it otherwise would have high tide always and a full moon every night
junes too soon julys too late  for summer
april comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers
autumn arrives in the early morning but spring at the close of a winters day
autumn is the bite of a harvest apple
may is a pious fraud of the almanac a ghastly parody of real spring shaped out of snow and breathed with eastern wind
the first day of spring was once the time for taking the young virgins into the fields there in dalliance to set an example in fertility for nature to follow
now we just set the clock an hour ahead and change the oil in the crankcase
there is honor among thieves
set a thief to catch a thief
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another
when thieves fall out honest men come by their own
stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant
a library is thought in cold storage
a man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought
there is a visible labour and there is an invisible labour
an englishman thinks seated a frenchman standing an american pacing an irishman afterward
analogies it is true decide nothing but they can make one feel more at home
data data everywhere but not a thought to think
one must live the way one thinks or end up thinking the way one has lived
one thought fills immensity
sometimes people mistake the way i talk for what i am thinking
thought is the labour of the intellect reverie is its pleasure
three minutes thought would suffice to find this out
but thought is irksome and three minutes is a long time
when thought becomes excessively painful action is the finest remedy
worrying is the most natural and spontaneous of all human functions
it is time to acknowledge this perhaps even to learn to do it better
all thought is a feat of association having whats in front of you bring up something in your mind that you almost didnt know you knew
we only think when we are confronted with a problem
the extra calories needed for one hour of intense mental effort would be completely met by eating one oyster cracker or one half of a salted peanut
every man who says frankly and fully what he thinks is doing a public service
thought is the strongest thing we have
work done by true and profound thought  that is a real force
when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully
we find it hard to believe that other peoples thoughts are as silly as our own but they probably are
thinking is like loving and dying  each of us must do it for himself
a man of action forced into a state of thought is unhappy until he can get out of it
it is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd fashion
men use thought only to justify their wrongdoings and speech only to conceal their thoughts
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit
the real offence as she ultimately perceived was her having a mind of her own at all
her mind was to be his  attached to his own like a small garden plot to a deer park
to be uncertain is to be uncomfortable but to be certain is to be ridiculous
think wrongly if you please but in all cases think for yourself
the thoughts that come often unsought and as it were drop into the mind are commonly the most valuable of any we have
we shall succeed only so far as we continue that most distasteful of all activity the intolerable labour of thought
profundity of thought belongs to youth clarity of thought to old age
every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of somebody or other
what was once thought can never be unthought
many a time i have wanted to stop talking and find out what i really believed
man is a slow sloppy and brilliant thinker the machine is fast accurate and stupid
folks that blurt out just what they think wouldnt be so bad if they thought
facts in books statistics in encyclopedias the ability to use them in mens heads
knowledge is a process of piling up facts wisdom lies in their simplification
the fundamental fact about the greek was that he had to use his mind
the ancient priests had said thus far and no farther
we set the limits of thought
the greek said all things are to be examined and called into question
there are no limits set on thought
thought is born of failure
speaking without thinking is shooting without taking aim
what you think is an illusion created by your glands your emotions and in the last analysis by the content of your stomach
that gray matter youre so proud of is like a mirror in an amusement park which transmits to you nothing but distorted signals from reality forever beyond your grasp
many highly intelligent people are poor thinkers
many people of average intelligence are skilled thinkers
the power of a car is separate from the way the car is driven
belief is harder to shake than knowledge
the bliss een of a moment still is bliss
every second is of infinite value
the bliss een of a moment still is bliss
let me tell thee time is a very precious gift of god so precious that its only given to us moment by moment
there are half hours that dilate to the importance of centuries
thisthis was what made life a moment of quiet the water falling in the fountain the girls voice  a moment of captured beauty
he who is truly wise will never permit such moments to escape
we do not remember days we remember moments
life is a succession of moments
to live each one is to succeed
the span of life is waning fast beware unthinking youth beware
thy souls eternity depends upon the record moments bear
florence farr once said to me if we could say to ourselves with sincerity this passing moment is as good as any i shall ever know we could die upon the instant and be united with god
sometimes i would almost rather have people take away years of my life than take away a moment
life is not lost by dying life is lost minute by minute day by day in all the thousand small uncaring ways
i have the happiness of the passing moment and what more can mortal ask
the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment
i always say to myself what is the most important thing we can think about at this extraordinary moment
fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run
the present moment is creative creating with an unheardof intensity
the only way to live is to accept each minute as an unrepeatable miracle which is exactly what it is a miracle and unrepeatable
who makes quick use of the moment is a genius of prudence
i live now and only now and i will do what i want to do this moment and not what i decided was best for me yesterday
but what minutes
count them by sensation and not by calendars and each moment is a day
it may be life is only worthwhile at moments
perhaps that is all we ought to expect
to finish the moment to find the journeys end in every step of the road to live the greatest number of good hours is wisdom
our latest moment is always our supreme moment
five minutes delay in dinner now is more important than a great sorrow ten years gone
god speaks to all individuals through what happens to them moment by moment
be always resolute with the present hour
every moment is of infinite value
a players effectiveness is directly related to his ability to be right there doing that thing in the moment

he cant be worrying about the past or the future or the crowd or some other extraneous event
he must be able to respond in the here and now
we inhabit ourselves without valuing ourselves unable to see that here now this very moment is sacred but once its goneits value is incontestable
life is all memory except for the one present moment that goes by so quick you can hardly catch it going
the trouble is not that we are never happyit is that happiness is so episodical
noncooks think its silly to invest two hours work in two minutes enjoyment but if cooking is evanescent so is the ballet
we have only this moment sparkling like a star in our hand  and melting like a snowflake
let us use it before it is too late
it is privilege of living to be  acutely agonizingly conscious of the moment that is always present and always passing
the passing moment is all we can be sure of it is only common sense to extract its utmost value from it
he is blessed over all mortals who loses no moment of the passing life
we must not wish anything other than what happens from moment to moment all the while however exercising ourselves in goodness
the only courage that matters is the kind that gets you from one moment to the next
the moment of change is the only poem
if it werent for the last minute nothing would get done
once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide
and the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light
i have always felt that the moment when first you wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twentyfour hours
no matter how weary or dreary you may feel you possess the certainty that absolutely anything may happen
and the fact that it practically always doesnt matters not one jot
the possibility is always there
every age can be enchanting provided you live within it
to live exhilaratingly in and for the moment is deadly serious work fun of the most exhausting sort
love the moment and the energy of the moment will spread beyond all boundaries
life isnt a matter of milestones but of moments
the power of thought  the magic of the mind
my thoughts ran a woolgathering
any man may make a mistake none but a fool will stick to it
second thoughts are best as the proverb says
learning without thought is labor lost
i think therefore i am
thoughts that breathe and words that burn
great thoughts reduced to practice become great acts
the mind grows by what it feeds on
a penny for your thought
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature
as he thinketh in his heart so is he
there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous
they are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts
great thoughts come from the heart
its no use filling your pocket with money if you have got a hole in the corner
a penny saved is a penny earned
it is better to have a hen tomorrow than an egg today
he that will not stoop for a pin will never be worth a pound
a man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man because he has both enjoyments
that great artillery of god almighty
3 oclock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do
all movements go too far
nothing is improbable until it moves into the past tense
nothing really belongs to us but time which even he has who has nothing else
respect the past in the full measure of its desserts but do not make the mistake of confusing it with the present nor seek in it the ideals of the future
the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough
the passing minute is every mans equal possession but what has once gone by is not ours
this only is denied even to god the power to undo the past
time is a test of trouble  but not a remedy  if such it proved it proves too there was no melody
time is the rider that breaks youth
to excel the past we must not allow ourselves to lose contact with it on the contrary we must feel it under our feet because we raised ourselves upon it
time is a great legalizer even in the fields of morals
time goes you say
ah no
alas time stays we go
let time that makes you homely make you sage
i dont ask for your pity but just your understanding  no not even that no
just for your recognition of me in you and the enemy time in us all
all things flow nothing abides
when you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think its only a minute
but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think its two hours
thats relativity
there was a young lady named bright who could travel much faster than light she started one day in the relative way and came back on the previous night
longevity conquers scandal every time
what may be done at any time will be done at no time

time and i against any two
time discovered truth
time gives good advice
what a day may bring a day may take away
time is a kindly god
time goes by reputation increases ability declines
time cools time clarifies no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours
every minute starts an hour
time wounds all heels
the apparent serenity of the past is an oil spread by time
time is a sort of river of passing events and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place and this too will be swept away
it takes time to save time
the mind of man works with strangeness upon the body of time
an hour once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length on the other hand an hour may be accurately represented by the timepiece of the mind by one second
when you have a great and difficult task something perhaps almost impossible if you only work a little at a time every day a little suddenly the work will finish itself

they climb the mountain one step at a time
they have no use for helicopters
the world doesnt come to the clever folks it comes to the stubborn obstinate oneideaatatime people
one of the greatest evils of the day among those outside of prison is their sense of futility
young people say what is the sense of our small effort

nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs
let no one be deluded that a knowledge of the path can substitute for putting one foot in front of the other
look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it

home wasnt built in a day
happiness is a tide it carries you only a little way at a time but you have covered a vast space before you know that you are moving at all
not to go back is somewhat to advance
and men must walk at least before they dance
great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
wellbeing is attained little by little and is no little thing itself
bigness comes from doing many small things well

individually they are not very dramatic transactions
together though they add up
if you only keep adding little by little it will soon become a big heap
he who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance one cannot fly into flying
all that i have accomplished  has been by that plodding patient persevering process of accretion which builds the ant heap particle by particle thought by thought fact by fact
if we take care of the moments the years will take care of themselves
many things which cannot be overcome when they are together yield themselves up when taken little by little
true worth is doing each day some little good not dreaming of great things to do by and by
little by little does the trick
it is by attempting to reach the top at a single leap that so much misery is caused in the world

i think and think for months for years
ninetynine times the conclusion is false

one thing at a time all things in succession
that which grows slowly endures

many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak
progress is the sum of small victories won by individual human beings

one brick upon another and the tallest wall is made
one flake and then another and the deepest snow is laid
you dont just luck into things
you build step by step whether its friendships or opportunities
the way a chihuahua goes about eating a dead elephant is to take a bite and be very present with that bite
in spiritual growth the definitive act is to take one step and let tomorrows step take care of itself
victory is won not in miles but in inches
win a little now hold your ground and later win a little more
it is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen
inches make a champion
yard by yard its very hard
but inch by inch its a cinch
if we take care of the inches we will not have to worry about the miles
when ty cobb got on first base he had an apparently nervous habit of kicking the bag

he figured that this improved his chances for a steal or for reaching second base safely on a hit
yard by yard its very hard
but inch by inch its a cinch

nothing can be done except little by little
practice yourself in little things and thence proceed to greater
those people work more wisely who seek to achieve good in their own small corner of the world  than those who are forever thinking that life is in vain unless one can  do big things

little strokes fell great oaks
take your needle my child and work at your pattern it will come out a rose by and by
life is like that one stitch at a time taken patiently and the pattern will come out all right like embroidery
why not learn to enjoy the little thingsthere are so many of them
human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day
the mere sense of living is joy enough
trifles make up the happiness or the misery of mortal life
even a small star shines in the darkness
how far that little candle throws his beams
so shines a good deed in a naughty world
it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
if you dont enjoy getting up and working and finishing your work and sitting down to a meal with family or friends then the chances are youre not going to be happy
if someone bases his happiness or unhappiness on major events like a great new job huge amounts of money a flawlessly happy marriage or a trip to paris that person isnt going to be happy much of the time
if on the other hand happiness depends on a good breakfast flowers in the yard a drink or a nap then we are more likely to live with quite a bit of happiness

too much truth is uncouth
truth is a child of time
time trieth truth
truth always lags last limping along on the arm of time

every man has a right to utter what he thinks is truth and every other man has a right to knock him down for it

every emancipation has in it the seeds of a new slavery and every truth easily becomes a lie
in every generation there has to be some fool who will speak the truth as he sees it
every truth passes through three stages before it is recognized
in the first it is ridiculed in the second it is opposed in the third it is regarded as selfevident
no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause im ready to accept even death
the passion for truth is silenced by answers which have the weight of undisputed authority
a truth thats told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent
he who when called upon to speak a disagreeable truth tells it boldly and has done is both bolder and milder than he who nibbles in a low voice and never ceases nibbling
we call first truths those we discover after all the others
as scarce as truth is the supply has always been in excess of the demand
i speak the truth not so much as i would but as much as i dare and i dare a little more as i grow older
between whom there is hearty truth there is love
everything has to be taken on trust truth is only that which is taken to be true
its the currency of living
there may be nothing behind it but it doesnt make any difference so long as it is honoured
one truth discovered one pang of regret at not being able to express it is better than all the fluency and flippancy in the world
if you speak the truth have a foot in the stirrup
the man who fears no truths has nothing to fear from lies

bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny
unlimited power corrupts the possessor and this i know that where law ends there tyranny begins
he who strikes terror into others is himself in continual fear
tyrants have not yet discovered any chains that can fetter the mind
resistance to tyrants is obedience to god
arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness
tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
better an ugly face than an ugly mind
absolute and entire ugliness is rare
nobodys sweetheart is ugly
is anyone in all the world safe from unhappiness
unhappiness is the ultimate form of selfindulgence
unhappiness indicates wrong thinking just as ill health indicates a bad regimen
unhappiness is best defined as the difference between our talents and our expectations
by becoming more unhappy we sometimes learn how to be less so

the worst sinperhaps the only sin passion can commit is to be joyless
those who are unhappy have no need for anything in this world but people capable of giving them their attention
irresolution on the schemes of life i which offer themselves to our choice and inconstancy in pursuing them are the greatest causes of all unhappiness
o lord
unhappy is the man whom man can make unhappy

nurse one vice in your bosom
give it the attention it deserves and let your virtues spring up modestly around it
then youll have the miser whos no liar and the drunkard whos the benefactor of a whole city
the vices we scoff at in others laugh at us within ourselves
it is the function of vice to keep virtue within reasonable grounds
when our vices leave us we flatter ourselves with the credit of having left them
many without punishment none without sin
if individuals have no virtues their vices may be of use to us
if you dont want anyone to know it dont do it
ill habits gather by unseen degrees as brooks make rivers rivers run to seas
vice can be learnt even without a teacher
theres a small choice in rotten apples

to the victors belong the spoils
who overcomes by force hath overcome but half his foe
there are some defeats more triumphant than victories
we have met the enemy and they are ours
it is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence
keep violence in the mind where it belongs
violence is the quest for identity
when identity disappears with technological innovation violence is the natural recourse
violence is essentially wordless and it can begin only where thought and rational communication have broken down
you know what i think about violence
for me it is profoundly moral more moral than compromises and transactions
violence is just where kindness is vain
it is unfair to blame man too fiercely for being pugnacious he learned the habit from nature
is some cases nonviolence requires more militancy than violence
we are all shot through with enough motives to make a massacre any day of the week that we want to give them their head
in a war of ideas it is people who get killed
the private terror of the liberal spirit is invariably suicide not murder
violence is essentially a confession of ultimate inarticulateness

a tragic situation exists precisely when virtue does not triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him
humility is a virtue and it is a virtue innate in guests
the sun though it passes through dirty places yet remains as pure as before
there are few virtues which the poles do not possess and there are few errors they have ever avoided
virtue has its own reward but no sale at the box office
when virtue has slept she will get up more refreshed
few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder
purity is obscurity
i know myself too well to believe in pure virtue
there are few chaste women who are not tired of their trade
ascetic one who makes a necessity of virtue
a virtue to be serviceable must like gold be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal

ones outlook is a part of his virtue
virtue is like a rich stone best plain set
recommend to your children virtue that alone can make them happy not gold
honor is the reward of virtue
i believe that virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen
there are those who have nothing chaste but their ears and nothing virtuous but their tongues
the only reward of virtue is virtue
most men admire virtue who follow not her lore
our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised
virtue is an angel but she is a blind one and must ask of knowledge to show her the pathway that leads to her goal
i prefer an accommodation vice to an obstinate virtue
virtue is health vice is sickness
virtue consists not in abstaining from vice but in not desiring it
virtue often trips and falls on the sharpedged rock of poverty
abou ben adhem may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace and saw within the moonlight in his room making it rich and like a lily in bloom an angel writing in a book of gold exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold and to the presence in the room he said   what writest thou
the vision raised its head and with a look made all of sweet accord answered the names of those who love the lord
where there is no vision the people perish
and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions
my thoughts by night are often filled with visions false as fair for in the past alone i build my castles in the air
before you begin a thing remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead
you can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal
form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin
man can only receive what he sees himself receiving
a person can grow only as much as his horizon allows
all prosperity begins in the mind and is dependent only upon the full use of our creative imagination
if we have not achieved our early dreams we must either find new ones or see what we can salvage from the old
if we have accomplished what we set out to do in our youth we need not weep like alexander the great that we have no more worlds to conquer
what man can imagine he may one day achieve
envisioning the end is enough to put the means in motion
our visions begin with our desires
it is in our idleness in our dreams that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top
one must desire something to be alive perhaps absolute satisfaction is only another name for death
the truth isnt always beauty but the hunger for it is
when your dreams tire they go underground and out of kindness thats where they stay
nothing happens unless first a dream
the very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for
and the most you can do is live inside that hope
not admire it from a distance but live right in it under its roof
the history of all times and of today especially teaches that women will be forgotten if they forget to think about themselves

it takes twenty years of hard work to become an overnight success
to the lack of incentive to effort which is the awful shadow under which we live may be traced the wreck and ruin of scores of colored youth
the moment of enlightenment is when a persons dreams of possibilities become images of probabilities

i think at a childs birth if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift that gift should be curiosity
you know my children that humanity advances only by forming itself an ideal and endeavoring to realize it
every passion has its ideal which is modified by that of the whole
it seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are alive
there are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good and we must hunger for them
the best antidote i have found is to yearn for something
as long as you yearn you cant congeal there is a forward motion to yearning
every woman dreams of her own political career and her own place in life
dream lofty dreams and as you dream so shall you become
your vision is the promise of what you shall at last unveil
imagination is the highest kite that can fly
who would ever give up the reality of dreams for relative knowledge
dreams are the sources of action the meeting and the end a resting place among the flight of things
within your heart keep one still secret spot where dreams may go
ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind
it may be that those who do most dream most
ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind
its our dreams that keep us going that separate us from the beasts
i wouldnt even want to live if i thought it was all just eating and sleeping and taking off my clothes
a couple of times a day i sit quietly and visualize my body fighting the aids virus
its the same as me sitting and seeing myself hit the perfect serve
i did that often when i was an athlete
is life so wretched
isnt it rather your hands which are too small your vision which is muddled
you are the one who must grow up
imagination has always had powers of resurrection that no science can match
the artist doesnt see things as they are but as he is
makebelieve colors the past with innocent distortion and it swirls ahead of us in a thousand waysin science in politics in every bold intention
it is part of our collective lives entwining our past and our future  a particularly rewarding aspect of life itself
we are governed not by armies but by ideas
one of your most powerful inner resources is your own creativity
be willing to try on something new and play the game fullout
no vision and you perish no ideal and youre lost your heart must ever cherish some faith at any cost
some hope some dream to cling to some rainbow in the sky some melody to sing to some service that is high
five minutes just before going to sleep given to a bit of directed imagination regarding achievement possibilities of the morrow will steadily and increasingly bear fruit particularly if all ideas of difficulty worry or fear are resolutely ruled out and replaced by those of accomplishment and smiling courage
with our progress we have destroyed our only weapon against tedium that rare weakness we call imagination
you can vitally influence your life from within by autosuggestion
the first thing each morning and the last thing each night suggest to yourself specific ideas that you wish to embody in your character and personality
address such suggestions to yourself silently or aloud until they are deeply impressed upon your mind
leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear and no concept of the odds against them
they make the impossible happen
when there is no vision people perish
the voice of the people is the voice of god
the voice of one crying in the wilderness
her voice was ever soft gentle and low an excellent thing in woman
a fair days wages for a fair days work it is as just a demand as governed men ever made of government
it is but a truism that labor is most productive where its wages are largest
poorly paid labor is inefficient labor the world over
the laborer is worthy of his hire
be content with your wages
the iron law of wages
man wants but little here below nor wants that little long
constantly choose rather to want less than to have more
the stoical scheme of supplying our wants by lopping off our desires is like cutting off our feet when we want shoes
how few our real wants and how vast our imaginary ones
a conventional army loses if it does not win
the guerrilla wins if it does not lose
above all vietnam was a war that asked everything of a few and nothing of most in america

good things when short are twice as good
i have never understood disliking for war
it panders to instincts already catered for within the scope of any respectable domestic establishment
if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand
in time of war the devil makes more room in hell
in war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts
let us not be deceived  we are today in the midst of a cold war
let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that if the british empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years men will still say this was their finest hour
morality is contraband in war
scots wha hae wi wallace bled scots wham bruce has aften led welcome to your gory bed or to victorie
so long as the antimilitarists propose no substitute for wars disciplinary function no moral equivalent of war analogous as one might say to the mechanical equivalent of hate so long they fail to realize the full equities of the situation
television brought the brutality of war into the comfort of the living room
vietnam was lost in the living rooms of usa  not on the battlefields of vietnam
the quickest way of ending a war is to lose it
there never was a good war or a bad peace
they will conquer but they will not convince
we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother
tweedle dum and tweedle dee agreed to have a battle for tweedle dum said tweedle dee had spoiled his nice new rattle

we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
when the rich wage war its the poor who die
we only win at war because we fight another government
if we fought private industry we would not last until noontime
war is much too important a matter to be left to the generals
war is mainly a catalogue of blunders
war is a series of catastrophes which result in victory
it would indeed be a tragedy if the history of the human race proved to be nothing more than the story of an ape playing with a box of matches on a petrol dump
either war is obsolete or men are
war appeals to young men because it is fundamentally autoeroticism
wars are not fought for territory but for words
mans deadliest weapon is language
he is as susceptible to being hypnotized by slogans as he is to infectious diseases
and where there is an epidemic the groupmind takes over
a war regarded as inevitable or even probable and therefore much prepared for has a very good chance of eventually being fought
war is the unfolding of miscalculations
if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles
today the real test of power is not capacity to make war but capacity to prevent it
as long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination
when it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular
what the hell difference does it make left or right
there were good men lost on both sides
the supreme excellence is not to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles
the supreme excellence is to subdue the armies of your enemies without even having to fight them
frankly id like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry
war is the national industry of prussia

there is no such thing as inevitable war
if war comes it will be from failure of human wisdom
the world will never have lasting peace so long as men reserve for war the finest human qualities
war would end if the dead could return
if they want peace nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede cannon shots
sometime theyll give a war and nobody will come
a man who experiences no genuine satisfaction in life does not want peace
people court war to escape meaninglessness and boredom to be relieved of fear and frustration
the object of war is to survive it
so far war has been the only force that can discipline a whole community and until an equivalent discipline is organized i believe that war must have its way
men love war because it allows them to look serious because it is the only thing that stops women laughing at them

taxes widows wooden legs and debt
the brazen throat of war
god how the dead men grin by the wall watching the fun of the victory ball

sleeping is no mean art
for its sake one must stay awake all day
sleep faster we need the pillows
that we are not much sicker and much madder than we are is due exclusively to that most blessed and blessing of all natural graces sleep
i never sleep in comfort save when i am hearing a sermon or praying to god
sleep  kinsman thou to death and trance and madness
thou hast been called o sleep
the friend of woe but tis the happy who have called thee so
yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
sleep takes off the costume of circumstance arms us with terrible freedom so that every will rushes to deed
a skillful man reads his dreams for his selfknowledge yet not the details but the quality
what part does he play in them  a cheerful manly part or a poor drivelling part
however monstrous and grotesque their apparitions they have a substantial truth

april is the crudest month breeding lilacs out of the dead land mixing memory and desire stirring dull roots with spring rain
man is worse than an animal when he is an animal
men are always wicked at bottom unless they are made good by some compulsion
god bears with the wicked but not forever
weak men are apt to be cruel because they stick at nothing that may repair the ill effect of their mistakes
all cruelty springs from weakness
i must be cruel only to be kind
we are oftener treacherous through weakness than through calculation
when we do evil we and our victims are equally bewildered
half of the harm that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important

god bears with the wicked but not forever

nothing is easy to the unwilling
the greatest intellectual capacities are only found in connection with a vehement and passionate will
the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
the difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one often comes from a strong will and the other from a strong wont
this freewill business is a bit terrifying anyway
its almost pleasanter to obey and make the most of it
fall seven times stand up eight
where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great
the will is the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man who can see
obstinacy is the result of the will forcing itself into the place of the intellect

he who is firm in will molds the world to himself
not my will but thine be done
an ill wind that bloweth no man good   the blower of which blast is she
